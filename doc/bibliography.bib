  abstract     = {The extended aeration activated sludge (EAAS)
    process is one of the most applied biological processes in small
    towns. Here, we study the abundance and viability of total
    bacterial cells in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
    operating with an EAAS process. We use flow cytometry (FCM)
    combined with SYTO13 and propidium iodide (PI) dyes as a rapid,
    easy, reliable and accurate microbial monitoring tool. A
    disaggregation procedure with an ultrasonic bath was designed to
    detach total bacterial cells from activated sludge flocs for
    subsequent FCM analysis. This procedure permitted the recovery of
    total bacterial cells from sludge flocs without affecting
    bacterial viability, as indicated by bacterial strain controls.
    Since FCM is a multi-parameter technique, it was possible to
    determine total bacterial abundance and their viability in the
    activated sludge. As a comparative method, epifluorescence
    microscopy was also used to quantify total bacterial cells; both
    methods produced similar results. The FCM analysis revealed
    relative microbial stability in both the WWTPs. The total
    bacterial abundance quantified by FCM in the two plants studied
    was 1.02-6.23\,×\,10(11) cells L(-1) with 70-72~\% viability, one
    logarithm less than that reported in the literature for WWTPs
    using the conventional activated sludge process. This can be
    explained by the difference in the operational parameters between
    the conventional plant and EAAS, mainly the organic loading rate.},

    have limited understanding of the mechanisms that lead to altered
    community structures. One difficulty with studying these
    mechanisms in human subjects is the inherent baseline variability
    of the microbiota in different individuals. In an effort to
    overcome this baseline variability, we employed a mouse model to
    control the host genotype, diet, and other possible influences on
    the microbiota. This allowed us to determine whether the
    indigenous microbiota in such mice had a stable baseline community
    structure and whether this community exhibited a consistent
    response following antibiotic administration. We employed a
    tag-sequencing strategy targeting the V6 hypervariable region of
    the bacterial small-subunit (16S) rRNA combined with massively
    parallel sequencing to determine the community structure of the
    gut microbiota. Inbred mice in a controlled environment harbored a
    reproducible baseline community that was significantly impacted by
    antibiotic administration. The ability of the gut microbial
    community to recover to baseline following the cessation of
    antibiotic administration differed according to the antibiotic
    regimen administered. Severe antibiotic pressure resulted in
    reproducible, long-lasting alterations in the gut microbial
    community, including a decrease in overall diversity. The finding
    of stereotypic responses of the indigenous microbiota to ecologic
    stress suggests that a better understanding of the factors that

    information. Analyzing compositional data using conventional
    correlation methods has been shown prone to bias that leads to
    artifactual correlations. RESULTS: We propose a novel method,
    regularized estimation of the basis covariance based on
    compositional data (REBACCA), to identify significant
    co-occurrence patterns by finding sparse solutions to a system
    with a deficient rank. To be specific, we construct the system
    using log ratios of count or proportion data and solve the system
    using the l1-norm shrinkage method. Our comprehensive simulation
    studies show that REBACCA (i) achieves higher accuracy in general
    than the existing methods when a sparse condition is satisfied;
    (ii) controls the false positives at a pre-specified level, while
    other methods fail in various cases and (iii) runs considerably
    faster than the existing comparable method. REBACCA is also
    applied to several real metagenomic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND

  abstract     = {Inflammatory lung diseases are characterised by
    increased expression of multiple inflammatory genes that are
    regulated by proinflammatory transcription factors, such as
    nuclear factor-kappa B. Gene expression is regulated by
    acetylation of core histones through the action of coactivators,
    such as CREB-binding protein, with intrinsic histone
    acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Conversely, gene repression is
    mediated via histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other corepressors.
    In asthma, there is an increase in HAT activity and some reduction
    in HDAC activity, which is restored by corticosteroid therapy.
    Corticosteroids switch off inflammatory genes in asthma through
    the inhibition of HAT activity and by the recruitment of HDAC2 to
    the activated inflammatory gene complex. In chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease, there is a reduction in HDAC2 activity and
    expression, which may account for the amplified inflammation and
    resistance to the actions of corticosteroids. The reduction in
    HDAC2 may be secondary to oxidative and nitrative stress as a
    result of cigarette smoking and severe inflammation, and may also
    occur in severe asthma, smoking asthmatic patients and cystic
    fibrosis. Similar mechanisms may also account for the steroid
    resistance seen with latent adenovirus infections. The reduction
    in histone deacetylase activity can be restored by theophylline,

  abstract     = {Acarbose is a safe and effective medication for type
    2 diabetes that inhibits host glucoamylases to prevent starch
    digestion in the small intestines and thus decrease postprandial
    blood glucose levels. This results in an increase in dietary
    starch in the distal intestine, where it becomes food for the gut
    bacterial community. Here, we examined the effect of acarbose
    therapy on the gut community structure in mice fed either a
    high-starch (HS) or high-fiber diet rich in plant polysaccharides
    (PP). The fecal microbiota of animals consuming a low dose of
    acarbose (25 ppm) was not significantly different from that of
    control animals that did not receive acarbose. However, a high
    dose of acarbose (400 ppm) with the HS diet resulted in a
    substantial change to the microbiota structure. Most notably, the
    HS diet with a high dose of acarbose lead to an expansion of the
    Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae and a decrease in the
    Verrucomicrobiaceae (such as Akkermansia muciniphila ) and the
    Bacteroidales S24-7. Once acarbose treatment ceased, the community
    composition quickly reverted to mirror that of the control group,
    suggesting that acarbose does not irreversibly alter the gut
    community. The high dose of acarbose in the PP diet resulted in a
    distinct community structure with increased representation of
    Bifidobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae . Short-chain fatty acids
    (SCFAs) measured from stool samples were increased, especially
    butyrate, as a result of acarbose treatment in both diets. These
    data demonstrate the potential of acarbose to change the gut
    community structure and increase beneficial SCFA output in a
    diet-dependent manner. IMPORTANCE The gut microbial community has
    a profound influence on host physiology in both health and
    disease. In diabetic individuals, the gut microbiota can affect
    the course of disease, and some medications for diabetes,
    including metformin, seem to elicit some of their benefits via an
    interaction with the microbiota. Here, we report that acarbose, a
    glucoamylase inhibitor for type 2 diabetes, changes the murine gut
    bacterial community structure in a reversible and diet-dependent
    manner. In both high-starch and high-fiber diet backgrounds,
    acarbose treatment results in increased short-chain fatty acids,
    particularly butyrate, as measured in stool samples. As we learn
    more about how human disease is affected by the intestinal
    bacterial community, the interplay between medications such as
    acarbose and the diet will become increasingly important to
    evaluate.},

    microbial activity in soil and may induce priming effects
    (PE)-short-term changes in SOM decomposition after substrate
    addition. The relationship between the origin of priming and
    growth characteristics of the microbial community is still
    unclear. We related real and apparent PEs induced by glucose and N
    addition with growth strategies of soil microorganisms. Two
    concentrations of uniformly labeled14C glucose with and without N
    were added to Chernozem, and the released14CO2and CO2efflux were
    monitored over a 300 h period. The shift in strategies after
    glucose addition was monitored by microbial growth kinetics based
    on the estimation of maximal specific growth rate. The production
    of unlabelled extra CO2induced by glucose was completed after 3
    days and amounted to about 15-19\% of the microbial biomass-C. The
    presence of real or apparent PE depended on the level of added C
    and N. An apparent positive PE was observed when the amount of
    applied glucose-C was 13 times lower than the amount of microbial
    biomass-C, i.e. under C-limiting conditions. Apparent PE was
    accompanied by a higher maximal microbial specific growth rate,
    i.e. by a shift towards r-strategy features. The absence of a
    priming effect was observed under N-limiting conditions at an
    eightfold excess of glucose-C versus microbial biomass-C. A large
    excess of glucose and N lowered maximal specific growth rates of
    soil microorganisms and had a negative priming effect.
    Accordingly, slow-growing microorganisms (K-strategists) switched
    from SOM mineralization to glucose uptake, probably due to
    preferential substrate utilization. Analysis of microbial growth
    kinetics was an efficient approach for evaluating short-term
    changes in the response of microorganisms to substrate addition;
    this approach is therefore suitable for assessing transitions

  abstract     = {The most frequently used models simulating soil
    organic matter (SOM) dynamics are based on first-order kinetics.
    These models fail to describe and predict such interactions as
    priming effects (PEs), which are short-term changes in SOM
    decomposition induced by easily available C or N sources. We
    hypothesized that if decomposition rate depends not only on size
    of the SOM pool, but also on microbial biomass and its activity,
    then PE can be simulated. A simple model that included these
    interactions and that consisted of three C pools - SOM, microbial
    biomass, and easily available C - was developed. The model was
    parameterized and evaluated using results
    of12C-CO2and14C-CO2efflux after adding14C-labeled glucose to a
    loamy Haplic Luvisol. Experimentally measured PE, i.e., changes in
    SOM decomposition induced by glucose, was compared with simulated
    PE. The best agreement between measured and simulated CO2efflux
    was achieved by considering both the total amount of microbial
    biomass and its activity. Because it separately described
    microbial turnover and SOM decomposition, the model successfully
    simulated apparent and real PE.The proposed PE model was compared
    with three alternative approaches with similar complexity but
    lacking interactions between the pools and neglecting the activity
    of microbial biomass. The comparison showed that proposed new
    model best described typical PE dynamics in which the first peak
    of apparent PE lasted for 1 day and the subsequent real PE
    gradually increased during 60 days. This sequential decomposition
    scheme of the new model, with immediate microbial consumption only
    of soluble substrate, was superior to the parallel decomposition
    scheme with simultaneous microbial consumption of two substrates
    with different decomposability. Incorporating microbial activity
    function in the model improved the fit of simulation results with
    experimental data, by providing the flexibility necessary to
    properly describe PE dynamics. We conclude that microbial biomass
    should be considered in models of C and N dynamics in soil not
    only as a pool but also as an active driver of C and N turnover. ©

    two natural fish populations (threespine stickleback and Eurasian

  abstract     = {Scythe uses a Naive Bayesian approach to classify

    information, which can make it robust in picking out 3'-end
    adapters, which often include poor quality bases. Most next
    generation sequencing reads have deteriorating quality towards the
    3'-end. It's common for a quality-based trimmer to be employed
    before mapping, assemblies, and analysis to remove these poor
    quality bases. However, quality-based trimming could remove bases
    that are helpful in identifying (and removing) 3'-end adapter
    contaminants. Thus, it is recommended you run Scythe before
    quality-based trimming, as part of a read quality control
    pipeline. The Bayesian approach Scythe uses compares two
    likelihood models: the probability of seeing the matches in a
    sequence given contamination, and not given contamination. Given
    that the read is contaminated, the probability of seeing a certain
    number of matches and mismatches is a function of the quality of
    the sequence. Given the read is not contaminated (and is thus
    assumed to be random sequence), the probability of seeing a
    certain number of matches and mismatches is chance. The posterior
    is calculated across both these likelihood models, and the class
    (contaminated or not contaminated) with the maximum posterior
    probability is the class selected.},

    formulated to deliver the drug to the lower bowel to leverage the
    gut-based mechanisms of metformin action with lower plasma
    exposure. Met DR was assessed in two studies. Study 1 compared the
    bioavailability of single daily doses of Met DR to currently
    available immediate-release metformin (Met IR) and
    extended-release metformin (Met XR) in otherwise healthy
    volunteers. Study 2 assessed glycemic control in subjects with
    type 2 diabetes (T2DM) over 12 weeks. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
    Study 1 was a phase 1, randomized, four-period crossover study in
    20 subjects. Study 2 was a 12-week, phase 2, multicenter,
    placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in 240 subjects with T2DM
    randomized to receive Met DR 600, 800, or 1,000 mg administered
    once daily; blinded placebo; or unblinded Met XR 1,000 or 2,000 mg
    (reference). RESULTS The bioavailability of 1,000 mg Met DR b.i.d.
    was ∼50\% that of Met IR and Met XR (study 1). In study 2, 600,
    800, and 1,000 mg Met DR q.d. produced statistically significant,
    clinically relevant, and sustained reductions in fasting plasma
    glucose (FPG) levels over 12 weeks compared with placebo, with an
    ∼40\% increase in potency compared with Met XR. The
    placebo-subtracted changes from baseline in HbA1c level at 12
    weeks were consistent with changes in FPG levels. All treatments
    were generally well tolerated, and adverse events were consistent
    with Glucophage/Glucophage XR prescribing information. CONCLUSIONS
    Dissociation of the glycemic effect from plasma exposure with
    gut-restricted Met DR provides strong evidence for a predominantly
    lower bowel-mediated mechanism of metformin action.},

    interest in the influence of the gastrointestinal tract on
    appetite regulation. Much of the focus has been on the neuronal
    and hormonal relationship between the gastrointestinal tract and
    the brain. There is now mounting evidence that the colonic
    microbiota and their metabolic activity have a significant role in
    energy homeostasis. The supply of substrate to the colonic
    microbiota has a major impact on the microbial population and the
    metabolites they produce, particularly short chain fatty acids
    (SCFAs). SCFAs are produced when non-digestible carbohydrates,
    namely dietary fibres and resistant starch, undergo fermentation
    by the colonic microbiota. Both the consumption of fermentable
    carbohydrates and the administration of SCFAs have been reported
    to result in a wide range of health benefits including
    improvements in body composition, glucose homeostasis, blood lipid
    profiles and reduced body weight and colon cancer risk. However,
    published studies tend to report the effects that fermentable
    carbohydrates and SCFAs have on specific tissues and metabolic
    processes, and fail to explain how these local effects translate
    into systemic effects and the mitigation of disease risk.
    Moreover, studies tend to investigate SCFAs collectively and
    neglect to report the effects associated with individual SCFAs.
    Here, we bring together the recent evidence and suggest an
    overarching model for the effects of SCFAs on one of their

  abstract     = {The connection between the gut microbiota and the
    aetiology of obesity and cardiometabolic disorders is increasingly
    being recognized by clinicians. Our gut microbiota might affect
    the cardiometabolic phenotype by fermenting indigestible dietary
    components and thereby producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA).
    These SCFA are not only of importance in gut health and as
    signalling molecules, but might also enter the systemic
    circulation and directly affect metabolism or the function of
    peripheral tissues. In this Review, we discuss the effects of
    three SCFA (acetate, propionate and butyrate) on energy
    homeostasis and metabolism, as well as how these SCFA can
    beneficially modulate adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver
    tissue function. As a result, these SCFA contribute to improved
    glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we also
    summarize the increasing evidence for a potential role of SCFA as
    metabolic targets to prevent and counteract obesity and its
    associated disorders in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance.
    However, most data are derived from animal and in vitro studies,
    and consequently the importance of SCFA and differential SCFA
    availability in human energy and substrate metabolism remains to
    be fully established. Well-controlled human intervention studies
    investigating the role of SCFA on cardiometabolic health are,
    therefore, eagerly awaited.},

    provide microbes a wide array of nutrient sources and survival
    challenges. Advances in technology such as DNA sequencing have
    allowed a deeper perspective into the molecular function of the
    human microbiota than has been achievable in the past. Here we
    aimed to examine the enzymes that cleave complex carbohydrates
    (CAZymes) in the human microbiome in order to determine (i)
    whether the CAZyme profiles of bacterial genomes are more similar
    within body sites or bacterial families and (ii) the sugar
    degradation and utilization capabilities of microbial communities
    inhabiting various human habitats. Upon examination of 493
    bacterial references genomes from 12 human habitats, we found that
    sugar degradation capabilities of taxa are more similar to others
    in the same bacterial family than to those inhabiting the same
    habitat. Yet, the analysis of 520 metagenomic samples from five
    major body sites show that even when the community composition
    varies the CAZyme profiles are very similar within a body site,
    suggesting that the observed functional profile and microbial
    habitation have adapted to the local carbohydrate composition.
    When broad sugar utilization was compared within the five major
    body sites, the gastrointestinal track contained the highest
    potential for total sugar degradation, while dextran and
    peptidoglycan degradation were highest in oral and vaginal sites
    respectively. Our analysis suggests that the carbohydrate
    composition of each body site has a profound influence and
    probably constitutes one of the major driving forces that shapes
    the community composition and therefore the CAZyme profile of the
    local microbial communities, which in turn reflects the microbiome
    fitness to a body site.},

    Refrigeration was associated with no significant alteration in

    underpinning central nervous system (CNS) signalling. Regulation
    of the microbiome--gut--brain axis is essential for maintaining
    homeostasis, including that of the CNS. However, there is a
    paucity of data pertaining to the influence of microbiome on the
    serotonergic system. Germ-free (GF) animals represent an effective
    preclinical tool to investigate such phenomena. Here we show that
    male GF animals have a significant elevation in the hippocampal
    concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
    acid, its main metabolite, compared with conventionally colonised
    control animals. Moreover, this alteration is sex specific in
    contrast with the immunological and neuroendocrine effects which
    are evident in both sexes. Concentrations of tryptophan, the
    precursor of serotonin, are increased in the plasma of male GF
    animals, suggesting a humoral route through which the microbiota
    can influence CNS serotonergic neurotransmission. Interestingly,
    colonisation of the GF animals post weaning is insufficient to
    reverse the CNS neurochemical consequences in adulthood of an
    absent microbiota in early life despite the peripheral
    availability of tryptophan being restored to baseline values. In
    addition, reduced anxiety in GF animals is also normalised
    following restoration of the intestinal microbiota. These results
    demonstrate that CNS neurotransmission can be profoundly disturbed
    by the absence of a normal gut microbiota and that this aberrant

    restoration of a normal gut flora in later life.},

    ubiquitous in nature, relatively little is known 8 about the
    structural and functional roles of their constituent organisms'
    underlying 9 interactions. A common approach to study such
    questions begins with extracting a 10 network of statistically
    significant pairwise co-­‐‑ occurrences from a matrix of observed
    11 operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances across sites. The
    structure of this 12 network is assumed to encode information
    about ecological interactions and processes, 13 resistance to
    perturbation, and the identity of keystone species. However,
    common 14 methods for identifying these pairwise interactions can
    contaminate the network with 15 spurious patterns that obscure
    true ecological signals. Here, we describe this problem 16 in
    detail and develop a solution that incorporates null models to
    distinguish ecological 17 signals from statistical noise. We apply
    these methods to the initial OTU abundance 18 matrix and to the
    extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to
    a 19 large soil microbiome data set and show that many previously
    reported patterns for 20 these data are statistical artifacts. In
    contrast, we find the frequency of three-­‐‑ way 21 interactions
    among microbial OTUs to be highly statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a gram-negative
    colonic anaerobe, can utilize three forms of starch: amylose,
    amylopectin, and pullulan. Previously, a neopullulanase, a
    pullulanase, and an alpha-glucosidase from B. thetaiotaomicron had
    been purified and characterized biochemically. The neopullulanase
    and alpha-glucosidase appeared to be the main enzymes involved in
    the breakdown of starch, because they were responsible for most of
    the starch-degrading activity detected in B. thetaiotaomicron cell
    extracts. To determine the importance of these enzymes in the
    starch utilization pathway, we cloned the genes encoding the
    neopullulanase and alpha-glucosidase. The gene encoding the
    neopullulanase (susA) was located upstream of the gene encoding
    the alpha-glucosidase (susB). Both genes were closely linked to
    another starch utilization gene, susC, which encodes a 115-kDa
    outer membrane protein that is essential for growth on starch. The
    gene encoding the pullulanase, pulI, was not located in this
    region in the chromosome. Disruption of the neopullulanase gene,
    susA, reduced the rate of growth on starch by about 30\%.
    Elimination of susA in this strain allowed us to detect a low
    residual level of enzyme activity, which was localized to the
    membrane fraction. Previously, we had shown that a disruption in
    the pulI gene did not affect the rate of growth on pullulan. We
    have now shown that a double mutant, with a disruption in susA and
    in the pullulanase gene, pulI, was also able to grow on pullulan.
    Thus, there is at least one other starch-degrading enzyme besides
    the neopullulanase and the pullulanase. Disruption of the
    alpha-glucosidase gene, susB, reduced the rate of growth on starch
    only slightly. No residual alpha-glucosidase activity was
    detectable in extracts from this strain. Since this strain could
    still grow on maltose, maltotriose, and starch, there must be at
    least one other enzyme capable of degrading the small oligomers
    produced by the starch-degrading enzymes. Our results show that
    the starch utilization system of B. thetaiotaomicron is quite
    complex and contains a number of apparently redundant degradative
    enzymes.},

    demonstrated that fungal diversity (number of fungal operational

    and activity of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the
    human gut, but it remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the
    human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change.
    Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed
    entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community
    structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial
    gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of
    bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and
    Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that
    metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium
    rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored
    differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals,
    reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein
    fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently
    colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses.
    Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila
    wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between
    dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms
    capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. In concert,
    these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly
    respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of
    human dietary lifestyles.},

    administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the
    host. Standard culture techniques are commonly used to quantify
    probiotic strains, but cell culture only measures replicating
    cells. In response to the stresses of processing and formulation,
    some fraction of the live probiotic microbes may enter a viable
    but non-culturable state (VBNC) in which they are dormant but
    metabolically active. These microbes are capable of replicating
    once acclimated to a more hospitable host environment. An
    operating definition of live probiotic bacteria that includes this
    range of metabolic states is needed for reliable enumeration.
    Alternative methods, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization
    (FISH), nucleic acid amplification techniques such as real-time
    quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR or qPCR), reverse transcriptase
    (RT-PCR), propidium monoazide-PCR, and cell sorting techniques
    such as flow cytometry (FC)/fluorescent activated cell sorting
    (FACS) offer the potential to enumerate both culturable and VBNC
    bacteria. Modern cell sorting techniques have the power to
    determine probiotic strain abundance and metabolic activity with
    rapid throughput. Techniques such as visual imaging, cell culture,
    and cell sorting, could be used in combination to quantify the
    proportion of viable microbes in various metabolic states.

    efforts to validate these alternative techniques ultimately will

    prevention of type 2 diabetes. The present study investigated the
    effects of acarbose treatment on the site and extent of starch
    digestion, large-bowel fermentation and intestinal mucosal cell
    proliferation. Eighteen young male Wistar rats were fed
    "Westernised" diets containing 0, 250 and 500 mg acarbose/kg (six
    rats/diet) for 21 d. For most variables measured, both acarbose
    doses had similar effects. Acarbose treatment suppressed starch
    digestion in the small bowel but there was compensatory salvage by
    bacterial fermentation in the large bowel. This was accompanied by
    a substantial hypertrophy of small- and large-bowel tissue and a
    consistent increase in crypt width along the intestine. Caecal
    total SCFA pool size was increased more than 4-fold, with even
    bigger increases for butyrate. These changes in butyrate were
    reflected in increased molar proportions of butyrate in blood from
    both the portal vein and heart. There was little effect of
    acarbose administration on crypt-cell proliferation (significant
    increase for mid-small intestine only). This is strong evidence
    against the hypothesis that increased fermentation and increased
    supply of butyrate enhances intestinal mucosal cell proliferation.
    In conclusion, apart from the increased faecal loss of starch,
    there was no evidence of adverse effects of acarbose on the

    In comparison, metagenomes facilitate highly resolved

    and individual genes across environments through read recruitment
    analyses. Combining these complementary approaches can yield
    unique insights into the functional basis of microbial niche
    partitioning and fitness, however, advanced software solutions are

    strategy that provides an interactive and reproducible framework
    to generate pangenomes and to study them in conjunction with
    metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we applied this strategy
    to a Prochlorococcus pangenome in the context of a large-scale
    marine metagenomic survey. The resulting Prochlorococcus
    metapangenome revealed remarkable differential abundance patterns
    between very closely related isolates that belonged to the same
    phylogenetic cluster and that differed by only a small number of
    gene clusters in the pangenome. While the relationships between
    these genomes based on gene clusters correlated with their
    environmental distribution patterns, phylogenetic analyses using
    marker genes or concatenated single-copy core genes did not
    recapitulate these patterns. The metapangenome also revealed a
    small set of core genes that mostly occurred in hypervariable
    genomic islands of the Prochlorococcus populations, which
    systematically lacked read recruitment from surface ocean
    metagenomes. Notably, these core gene clusters were all linked to
    sugar metabolism, suggesting potential benefits to Prochlorococcus
    from a high sequence diversity of sugar metabolism genes. The
    rapidly growing number of microbial genomes and increasing

    to achieve BLAST's speed while further improving the power of

    probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new
    heuristic acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient
    vector-parallel implementations on modern processors, these
    improvements synergize. HMMER3 uses more powerful log-odds
    likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment uncertainty,
    rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it calculates
    accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores without
    simulation using a generalization of Karlin/Altschul theory; it
    computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible
    alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in
    each aligned residue; and it does all this at an overall speed
    comparable to BLAST. The HMMER project aims to usher in a new

    Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical
    distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing
    rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus
    facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a
    20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward
    algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods
    are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are
    passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward
    algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely
    available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show
    that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible
    sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3

    We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and

    relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of

    and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and
    validated on a number of very large databases, including
    SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results
    indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and
    accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The

    RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Genetic (ob/ob) or diet-induced obese
    and diabetic mice were chronically fed with prebiotic-enriched
    diet or with a control diet. Extensive gut microbiota analyses,
    including quantitative PCR, pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA, and
    phylogenetic microarrays, were performed in ob/ob mice. The impact
    of gut microbiota modulation on leptin sensitivity was
    investigated in diet-induced leptin-resistant mice. Metabolic
    parameters, gene expression, glucose homeostasis, and
    enteroendocrine-related L-cell function were documented in both
    models. RESULTS: In ob/ob mice, prebiotic feeding decreased
    Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes phyla, but also changed 102
    distinct taxa, 16 of which displayed a {$>$}10-fold change in
    abundance. In addition, prebiotics improved glucose tolerance,
    increased L-cell number and associated parameters (intestinal
    proglucagon mRNA expression and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1
    levels), and reduced fat-mass development, oxidative stress, and
    low-grade inflammation. In high fat-fed mice, prebiotic treatment
    improved leptin sensitivity as well as metabolic parameters.
    CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that specific gut microbiota modulation
    improves glucose homeostasis, leptin sensitivity, and target
    enteroendocrine cell activity in obese and diabetic mice. By
    profiling the gut microbiota, we identified a catalog of putative
    bacterial targets that may affect host metabolism in obesity and

  abstract     = {The healthy microbiota show remarkable variability
    within and among individuals. In addition to external exposures,
    ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between
    microbial inhabitants are important contributors to this
    variation. It is thus of interest to assess what relationships
    might exist among microbes and determine their underlying reasons.
    The initial Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort, comprising 239
    individuals and 18 different microbial habitats, provides an
    unprecedented resource to detect, catalog, and analyze such
    relationships. Here, we applied an ensemble method based on
    multiple similarity measures in combination with generalized
    boosted linear models (GBLMs) to taxonomic marker (16S rRNA gene)
    profiles of this cohort, resulting in a global network of 3,005
    significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion relationships between
    197 clades occurring throughout the human microbiome. This network
    revealed strong niche specialization, with most microbial
    associations occurring within body sites and a number of
    accompanying inter-body site relationships. Microbial communities
    within the oropharynx grouped into three distinct habitats, which
    themselves showed no direct influence on the composition of the
    gut microbiota. Conversely, niches such as the vagina demonstrated
    little to no decomposition into region-specific interactions.
    Diverse mechanisms underlay individual interactions, with some
    such as the co-exclusion of Porphyromonaceae family members and
    Streptococcus in the subgingival plaque supported by known
    biochemical dependencies. These differences varied among broad
    phylogenetic groups as well, with the Bacilli and Fusobacteria,
    for example, both enriched for exclusion of taxa from other
    clades. Comparing phylogenetic versus functional similarities
    among bacteria, we show that dominant commensal taxa (such as
    Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides in the gut) often compete, while
    potential pathogens (e.g. Treponema and Prevotella in the dental
    plaque) are more likely to co-occur in complementary niches. This
    approach thus serves to open new opportunities for future targeted
    mechanistic studies of the microbial ecology of the human

    in degrading high molecular weight (HMW) compounds and to have a
    preference for growth attached to particles, surfaces or algal
    cells. The first sequenced genomes of marine Bacteroidetes seemed
    to confirm this assumption. Many more genomes have been sequenced
    recently. Here, a comparative analysis of marine Bacteroidetes
    genomes revealed a life strategy different from those of other
    important phyla of marine bacterioplankton such as Cyanobacteria
    and Proteobacteria. Bacteroidetes have many adaptations to grow
    attached to particles, have the capacity to degrade polymers,
    including a large number of peptidases, glycoside hydrolases
    (GHs), glycosyl transferases, adhesion proteins, as well as the
    genes for gliding motility. Several of the polymer degradation
    genes are located in close association with genes for
    TonB-dependent receptors and transducers, suggesting an integrated
    regulation of adhesion and degradation of polymers. This confirmed
    the role of this abundant group of marine bacteria as degraders of
    particulate matter. Marine Bacteroidetes had a significantly
    larger number of proteases than GHs, while non-marine
    Bacteroidetes had equal numbers of both. Proteorhodopsin
    containing Bacteroidetes shared two characteristics: small genome
    size and a higher number of genes involved in CO2 fixation per Mb.
    The latter may be important in order to survive when floating
    freely in the illuminated, but nutrient-poor, ocean surface.},

    tremendous influence over human health and disease. With modern
    metagenomic sequencing methods it is now possible to follow the
    relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These
    microbial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an
    important goal of microbial ecology is to infer the ecological
    interactions between species directly from sequence data. Any
    algorithm for inferring ecological interactions must overcome
    three major obstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of
    two species does not imply that those species are interacting, 2)
    the sum constraint on the relative abundances obtained from
    metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the parameters in
    timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty,
    or mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic
    units, bias inferences of species interactions due to a
    statistical problem called "errors-in-variables". Here we
    introduce an approach, Learning Interactions from MIcrobial Time
    Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these obstacles. LIMITS uses
    sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to infer a
    discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We
    tested LIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably
    infer the topology of the inter-species ecological interactions.
    We then used LIMITS to characterize the species interactions in
    the gut microbiomes of two individuals and found that the
    interaction networks varied significantly between individuals.
    Furthermore, we found that the interaction networks of the two
    individuals are dominated by distinct "keystone species",
    Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroided stercosis, that have a
    disproportionate influence on the structure of the gut microbiome
    even though they are only found in moderate abundance. Based on
    our results, we hypothesize that the abundances of certain
    keystone species may be responsible for individuality in the human
    gut microbiome.},

    intestinal tract must efficiently compete for carbohydrate
    nutrition. The Bacteroidetes, a dominant bacterial phylum in the
    mammalian gut, encode a plethora of discrete polysaccharide
    utilization loci (PULs) that are selectively activated to
    facilitate glycan capture at the cell surface. The most
    well-studied PUL-encoded glycan-uptake system is the starch
    utilization system (Sus) of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The Sus
    includes the requisite proteins for binding and degrading starch
    at the surface of the cell preceding oligosaccharide transport
    across the outer membrane for further depolymerization to glucose
    in the periplasm. All mammalian gut Bacteroidetes possess
    analogous Sus-like systems that target numerous diverse glycans.
    In this review, we discuss what is known about the eight Sus
    proteins of B. thetaiotaomicron that define the Sus-like paradigm
    of nutrient acquisition that is exclusive to the Gram-negative
    Bacteroidetes. We emphasize the well-characterized outer membrane
    proteins SusDEF and the α-amylase SusG, each of which have unique
    structural features that allow them to interact with starch on the
    cell surface. Despite the apparent redundancy in starch-binding
    sites among these proteins, each has a distinct role during starch
    catabolism. Additionally, we consider what is known about how
    these proteins dynamically interact and cooperate in the membrane
    and propose a model for the formation of the Sus outer membrane

    chronic human disorders and altered gut microbiome composition and
    function have been reported. In most of these reports, treatment
    regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be
    confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota,
    which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or
    diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and
    drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes
    mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies
    of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded
    divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial
    dysbiosis. Here we show, using 784 available human gut
    metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results,
    and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used
    antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial
    mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through
    short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential
    microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse
    effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of
    Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we
    report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a
    depletion of butyrate-producing taxa. These in turn cause
    functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by
    metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes
    the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific
    human diseases from those of medication.},

    a time-efficient flow-cytometric (FCM) counting method involving
    cell detachment and separation from matrix particles by
    centrifugation in tubes receiving sample suspensions and
    Histodenz® solution. We used this approach to assess bacterial
    abundances in diverse soils (natural and agricultural), sediments
    (streams and lakes) and sludge from sand-filters in a drinking
    water treatment plant and compare the results to bacterial
    abundances determined by two established methods, epifluorescence
    microscopy (EM) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification.
    Cell abundances determined by FCM and EM correlated fairly well,
    although absolute cell abundances were generally lower when
    determined by FCM. FCM also showed significant correlations with
    cell counts converted from ATP concentrations, although estimates
    derived from ATP determinations were typically higher, indicating
    the presence of ATP sources other than bacteria. Soil and sediment
    organic matter content influenced the goodness of fit between
    counts obtained with EM and FCM. In particular, bacterial
    abundance determined by FCM in samples containing less than 10 \%
    organic matter, such as stream sediment, was particularly well
    correlated with the cell counts assessed by EM. Overall, these
    results suggest that FCM following cell detachment and
    purification is a useful approach to increase sample throughput
    for determining bacterial abundances in soils, sediments and
    sludge. However, notable scatter and only partial concordance
    among the FCM and reference methods suggests that protocols
    require further improvement for assessments requiring high

    simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative
    simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested
    in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing,

    strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting

    the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand
    of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much
    sharper the distributional estimate might become if the
    simulations were contin- ued indefinitely. Because our focus is on
    applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real
    problems, which often tend toward normal- ity after
    transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as

    design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant
    results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this
    problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design
    calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in
    the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by
    which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M
    [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We
    illustrate with examples from recent published research and
    discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up
    with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on

    from environmental samples into the accurate representation of the
    underlying microbiomes's genomes. State-of-the-art tools require
    big shared memory machines and cannot handle contemporary
    metagenome datasets that exceed Terabytes in size. In this paper,
    we introduce the MetaHipMer pipeline, a high-quality and
    high-performance metagenome assembler that employs an iterative de
    Bruijn graph approach. MetaHipMer leverages a specialized
    scaffolding algorithm that produces long scaffolds and
    accommodates the idiosyncrasies of metagenomes. MetaHipMer is
    end-to-end parallelized using the Unified Parallel C language and
    therefore can run seamlessly on shared and distributed-memory
    systems. Experimental results show that MetaHipMer matches or
    outperforms the state-of-the-art tools in terms of accuracy.
    Moreover, MetaHipMer scales efficiently to large concurrencies and
    is able to assemble previously intractable grand challenge
    metagenomes. We demonstrate the unprecedented capability of
    MetaHipMer by computing the first full assembly of the Twitchell
    Wetlands dataset, consisting of 7.5 billion reads - size 2.6

    and marine biomass represent a rich nutrient source for

    saccharification of these diverse substrates is of critical
    importance for fueling a variety of complex microbial communities,
    including marine, soil, ruminant, and monogastric microbiota.
    Consequently, highly specific carbohydrate-active enzymes,
    recognition proteins, and transporters are enriched in the genomes
    of certain species and are of critical importance in competitive

    provides historical perspectives and summarizes key findings in
    the study of these systems, highlighting a critical shift from
    sequence-based PUL discovery to systems-based analyses combining
    reverse genetics, biochemistry, enzymology, and structural biology
    to precisely illuminate the molecular mechanisms underpinning PUL

    reduces symptoms of IBS, but reduction of potential prebiotic and

    microenvironment. The effects of a low FODMAP diet with a typical
    Australian diet on biomarkers of colonic health were compared in a
    single-blinded, randomised, cross-over trial. DESIGN: Twenty-seven
    IBS and six healthy subjects were randomly allocated one of two
    21-day provided diets, differing only in FODMAP content (mean
    (95\% CI) low 3.05 (1.86 to 4.25) g/day vs Australian 23.7 (16.9
    to 30.6) g/day), and then crossed over to the other diet with
    {$>$}/=21-day washout period. Faeces passed over a 5-day run-in on
    their habitual diet and from day 17 to day 21 of the
    interventional diets were pooled, and pH, short-chain fatty acid
    concentrations and bacterial abundance and diversity were
    assessed. RESULTS: Faecal indices were similar in IBS and healthy
    subjects during habitual diets. The low FODMAP diet was associated
    with higher faecal pH (7.37 (7.23 to 7.51) vs 7.16 (7.02 to 7.30);
    p=0.001), similar short-chain fatty acid concentrations, greater
    microbial diversity and reduced total bacterial abundance (9.63
    (9.53 to 9.73) vs 9.83 (9.72 to 9.93) log10 copies/g; p{$<$}0.001)
    compared with the Australian diet. To indicate direction of
    change, in comparison with the habitual diet the low FODMAP diet
    reduced total bacterial abundance and the typical Australian diet
    increased relative abundance for butyrate-producing Clostridium
    cluster XIVa (median ratio 6.62; p{$<$}0.001) and mucus-associated
    Akkermansia muciniphila (19.3; p{$<$}0.001), and reduced
    Ruminococcus torques. CONCLUSIONS: Diets differing in FODMAP

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is a
    main end-product of intestinal microbial fermentation of mainly
    dietary fibre. Butyrate is an important energy source for
    intestinal epithelial cells and plays a role in the maintenance of
    colonic homeostasis. AIM: To provide an overview on the present
    knowledge of the bioactivity of butyrate, emphasizing effects and
    possible mechanisms of action in relation to human colonic
    function. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to select
    relevant publications using the search terms: 'butyrate,
    short-chain fatty acid, fibre, colon, inflammation,
    carcinogenesis, barrier, oxidative stress, permeability and
    satiety'. RESULTS: Butyrate exerts potent effects on a variety of
    colonic mucosal functions such as inhibition of inflammation and
    carcinogenesis, reinforcing various components of the colonic
    defence barrier and decreasing oxidative stress. In addition,
    butyrate may promote satiety. Two important mechanisms include the
    inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation and histone
    deacetylation. However, the observed effects of butyrate largely
    depend on concentrations and models used and human data are still
    limited. CONCLUSION: Although most studies point towards
    beneficial effects of butyrate, more human in vivo studies are
    needed to contribute to our current understanding of
    butyrate-mediated effects on colonic function in health and

    methods to quantify viability of natural microbial communities in
    aquatic environments. Adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) is the energy
    currency of all living cells, and therefore a useful indicator of
    viability. A luminescence-based ATP kit/protocol was optimised in
    order to detect ATP concentrations as low as 0.0001nM with a
    standard deviation of {$<$}5\%. Using this method, more than 100
    water samples from a variety of aquatic environments (drinking
    water, groundwater, bottled water, river water, lake water and
    wastewater effluent) were analysed for extracellular ATP and
    microbial ATP in comparison with flow-cytometric (FCM) parameters.
    Microbial ATP concentrations ranged between 3\% and 97\% of total
    ATP concentrations, and correlated well (R2=0.8) with the
    concentrations of intact microbial cells (after staining with
    propidium iodide). From this correlation, we calculated an average
    ATP-per-cell value of 1.75×10-10nmol/cell. An even better
    correlation (R2=0.88) was observed between intact biovolume
    (derived from FCM scatter data) and microbial ATP concentrations,
    and an average ATP-per-biovolume value of 2.95×10-9nmol/μm3was
    calculated. These results support the use of ATP analysis for both

    which primers to use and how to taxonomically classify sequences.
    In this study, we explored how these choices affected a survey of
    microbial diversity in a sample taken from the aerobic basin of
    the activated sludge of a North Carolina wastewater treatment
    plant. We performed pyrosequencing reactions on PCR products
    generated from primers targeting the V1-V2, V6, and V6-V7 variable
    regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We compared these sequences to 16S
    rRNA gene sequences found in a whole-genome shotgun pyrosequencing
    run performed on the same sample. We found that sequences
    generated from primers targeting the V1-V2 variable region had the
    best match to the whole-genome shotgun reaction across a range of
    taxonomic classifications from phylum to family. Pronounced
    differences between primer sets, however, occurred in the "rare
    biosphere" involving taxa that we observed in fewer than 11
    sequences. We also examined the results of analysis strategies
    comparing a classification scheme using a nearest-neighbor
    approach to directly classifying sequences with a naïve Bayesian
    algorithm. Again, we observed pronounced differences between these
    analysis schemes in infrequently observed taxa. We conclude that

    either acarbose (n=1248) or placebo (n=932). The primary outcome
    measure was the time to develop a cardiovascular event. Primary
    analysis was conducted using Cox regression analysis. The effect
    of acarbose on metabolic parameters was also investigated.
    Acarbose therapy showed favourable trends towards risk reduction
    for all selected cardiovascular event categories. The treatment
    significantly reduced the risk for 'myocardial infarction'
    (hazards ratio=0.36 [95\% CI 16-0.80], P=0.0120) and 'any
    cardiovascular event' (0.65 [95\% CI 0.48-0.88], P=0.0061).
    Glycaemic control, triglyceride levels, body weight and systolic
    blood pressure also improved significantly during acarbose
    treatment. Conclusion: Intervention with acarbose can prevent
    myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease in type 2
    diabetic patients while most of them are already on intensive
    concomitant cardiovascular medication. ?? 2003 Published by

  abstract     = {Inhibition of the TOR signalling pathway by genetic
    or pharmacological intervention extends lifespan in invertebrates,
    including yeast, nematodes and fruitflies; however, whether
    inhibition of mTOR signalling can extend lifespan in a mammalian
    species was unknown. Here we report that rapamycin, an inhibitor
    of the mTOR pathway, extends median and maximal lifespan of both
    male and female mice when fed beginning at 600 days of age. On the
    basis of age at 90\% mortality, rapamycin led to an increase of
    14\% for females and 9\% for males. The effect was seen at three
    independent test sites in genetically heterogeneous mice, chosen
    to avoid genotype-specific effects on disease susceptibility.
    Disease patterns of rapamycin-treated mice did not differ from
    those of control mice. In a separate study, rapamycin fed to mice
    beginning at 270 days of age also increased survival in both males
    and females, based on an interim analysis conducted near the
    median survival point. Rapamycin may extend lifespan by postponing
    death from cancer, by retarding mechanisms of ageing, or both. To
    our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate a role
    for mTOR signalling in the regulation of mammalian lifespan, as
    well as pharmacological extension of lifespan in both genders.
    These findings have implications for further development of
    interventions targeting mTOR for the treatment and prevention of
    age-related diseases.},

    used to study the composition of the rumen microbiota and to
    increase understanding of the roles they play. Therefore, sampling
    and DNA extraction methods that result in adequate yields of
    microbial DNA that also accurately represents the microbial
    community are crucial. Fifteen different methods were used to
    extract DNA from cow and sheep rumen samples. The DNA yield and
    quality, and its suitability for downstream PCR amplifications
    varied considerably, depending on the DNA extraction method used.
    DNA extracts from nine extraction methods that passed these first
    quality criteria were evaluated further by quantitative PCR
    enumeration of microbial marker loci. Absolute microbial numbers,
    determined on the same rumen samples, differed by more than
    100-fold, depending on the DNA extraction method used. The
    apparent compositions of the archaeal, bacterial, ciliate
    protozoal, and fungal communities in identical rumen samples were
    assessed using 454 Titanium pyrosequencing. Significant
    differences in microbial community composition were observed
    between extraction methods, for example in the relative abundances
    of members of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Microbial
    communities in parallel samples collected from cows by oral
    stomach-tubing or through a rumen fistula, and in liquid and solid
    rumen digesta fractions, were compared using one of the DNA
    extraction methods. Community representations were generally
    similar, regardless of the rumen sampling technique used, but
    significant differences in the abundances of some microbial taxa
    such as the Clostridiales and the Methanobrevibacter ruminantium
    clade were observed. The apparent microbial community composition
    differed between rumen sample fractions, and Prevotellaceae were
    most abundant in the liquid fraction. DNA extraction methods that
    involved phenol-chloroform extraction and mechanical lysis steps
    tended to be more comparable. However, comparison of data from
    studies in which different sampling techniques, different rumen

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Murine models are a crucial component of
    gut microbiome research. Unfortunately, a multitude of genetic
    backgrounds and experimental setups, together with
    inter-individual variation, complicates cross-study comparisons
    and a global understanding of the mouse microbiota landscape.
    Here, we investigate the variability of the healthy mouse
    microbiota of five common lab mouse strains using 16S rDNA
    pyrosequencing. RESULTS: We find initial evidence for
    richness-driven, strain-independent murine enterotypes that show a
    striking resemblance to those in human, and which associate with
    calprotectin levels, a marker for intestinal inflammation. After
    enterotype stratification, we find that genetic, caging and
    inter-individual variation contribute on average 19\%, 31.7\% and
    45.5\%, respectively, to the variance in the murine gut microbiota
    composition. Genetic distance correlates positively to microbiota
    distance, so that genetically similar strains have more similar
    microbiota than genetically distant ones. Specific mouse strains
    are enriched for specific operational taxonomic units and
    taxonomic groups, while the 'cage effect' can occur across mouse
    strain boundaries and is mainly driven by Helicobacter infections.
    CONCLUSIONS: The detection of enterotypes suggests a common
    ecological cause, possibly low-grade inflammation that might drive
    differences among gut microbiota composition in mammals.
    Furthermore, the observed environmental and genetic effects have
    important consequences for experimental design in mouse microbiome

  abstract     = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain
    Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior
    and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC
    methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order
    gradient information. These features allow it to converge to
    high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than
    simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling.
    However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two
    user-specified parameters: a step size \{\textbackslash epsilon\}
    and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small
    then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior,
    while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We
    introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that
    eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a
    recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that
    spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping
    automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps.
    Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes
    more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without
    requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive
    a method for adapting the step size parameter \{\textbackslash
    epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus
    be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for
    applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that
    require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We introduce Dirichlet multinomial mixtures (DMM)
    for the probabilistic modelling of microbial metagenomics data.
    This data can be represented as a frequency matrix giving the
    number of times each taxa is observed in each sample. The samples
    have different size, and the matrix is sparse, as communities are
    diverse and skewed to rare taxa. Most methods used previously to
    classify or cluster samples have ignored these features. We
    describe each community by a vector of taxa probabilities. These
    vectors are generated from one of a finite number of Dirichlet
    mixture components each with different hyperparameters. Observed
    samples are generated through multinomial sampling. The mixture
    components cluster communities into distinct 'metacommunities',
    and, hence, determine envirotypes or enterotypes, groups of
    communities with a similar composition. The model can also deduce
    the impact of a treatment and be used for classification. We wrote
    software for the fitting of DMM models using the 'evidence
    framework' (http://code.google.com/p/microbedmm/). This includes
    the Laplace approximation of the model evidence. We applied the
    DMM model to human gut microbe genera frequencies from Obese and
    Lean twins. From the model evidence four clusters fit this data
    best. Two clusters were dominated by Bacteroides and were
    homogenous; two had a more variable community composition. We
    could not find a significant impact of body mass on community
    structure. However, Obese twins were more likely to derive from
    the high variance clusters. We propose that obesity is not
    associated with a distinct microbiota but increases the chance
    that an individual derives from a disturbed enterotype. This is an
    example of the 'Anna Karenina principle (AKP)' applied to
    microbial communities: disturbed states having many more
    configurations than undisturbed. We verify this by showing that in
    a study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) phenotypes, ileal
    Crohn's disease (ICD) is associated with a more variable
    community.},

    diabetes mellitus by delaying the digestion and intestinal
    absorption of dietary carbohydrates. In effective doses, acarbose
    induces some passage of carbohydrates into the colon. The effect
    of such chronic carbohydrate transfer on colonic structure and
    function is unknown. We studied the effects of 1 year of acarbose
    administration in diabetes mellitus on fecal energy, protein, and
    fat, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) output, fecal pH,
    and several metabolizing bacterial species. Changes in colonic
    histology and epithelial cell proliferation were investigated in
    rectal biopsies. Fecal macronutrient output was unaffected by
    acarbose, but pH decreased and total SCFA, butyrate, and acetate
    output were markedly greater. Breath hydrogen output increased
    after acarbose, but digoxin-metabolizing bacteria and
    diacylglycerol (DAG) production were unaltered. Compared with the
    control, acarbose did not induce hyperplasia or change rectal
    proliferation. However, total fecal SCFA and butyrate output
    correlated inversely with proliferation in the rectal upper
    crypt-a biomarker of risk for colonic neoplasia. In conclusion,
    long-term acarbose administration does not adversely affect
    colonic function or fecal nutrient output. If increased fecal SCFA
    and butyrate reduces upper-crypt proliferation, then acarbose may
    reduce the risk of colonic neoplasia.},

    amylolytic enzyme. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-1,4-glucosidic
    bonds in starch and related α-glucans. In general, the α-amylase
    is an enzyme with a broad substrate preference and product
    specificity. In the sequence-based classification system of all
    carbohydrate-active enzymes, it is one of the most frequently
    occurring glycoside hydro- lases (GH). α-Amylase is the main
    representative of family GH13, but it is probably also present in
    the families GH57 and GH119, and possibly even in GH126. Family
    GH13, known generally as the main α-amylase family, forms clan
    GH-H together with families GH70 and GH77 that, how- ever, contain
    no α-amylase. within the family GH13, the α-amylase specificity is
    currently present in several sub- families, such as GH13\_1, 5, 6,
    7, 15, 24, 27, 28, 36, 37, and, possibly in a few more that are
    not yet defined. The α-amylases classified in family GH13 employ a
    reaction mechanism giving retention of configuration, share 4–7
    conserved sequence regions (CSRs) and catalytic machin- ery, and
    adopt the (β/α)8-barrel catalytic domain. Although the family GH57
    α-amylases also employ the retaining reaction mechanism, they
    possess their own five CSRs and catalytic machinery, and adopt a
    (β/α)7-barrel fold. These Š. Janecˇek (*) Laboratory of Protein

    critical task in microbiome studies that is complicated by the

    solution from the field of gene expression analysis to produce a
    new method, discrete false-discovery rate (DS-FDR), that greatly
    improves the power to detect differential taxa by exploiting the
    discreteness of the data. Additionally, DS-FDR is relatively
    robust to the number of noninformative features, and thus removes
    the problem of filtering taxonomy tables by an arbitrary abundance
    threshold. We show by using a combination of simulations and
    reanalysis of nine real-world microbiome data sets that this new
    method outperforms existing methods at the differential abundance
    testing task, producing a false-discovery rate that is up to
    threefold more accurate, and halves the number of samples required
    to find a given difference (thus increasing the efficiency of
    microbiome experiments considerably). We therefore expect DS-FDR

  abstract     = {SignificanceThe field of microbiome research is
    moving from 16S rDNA gene sequencing to metagenomic sequencing of
    complete communities, which clearly gives a more comprehensive
    genomic and functional representation of the organisms present.
    Here we describe, quantify, and compare biases associated with
    four currently available next-generation sequencing library
    preparation methods using a synthetic DNA mock community and an
    extraction spike-in control of microbial cells. Our study
    highlights a critical need for consistency in protocols and data
    analysis procedures, especially when attempting to interpret human
    microbiome data for human health. Observations from human
    microbiome studies are often conflicting or inconclusive. Many
    factors likely contribute to these issues including small cohort
    sizes, sample collection, and handling and processing differences.
    The field of microbiome research is moving from 16S rDNA gene
    sequencing to a more comprehensive genomic and functional
    representation through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of complete
    communities. Here we performed quantitative and qualitative
    analyses comparing WGS metagenomic data from human stool specimens
    using the Illumina Nextera XT and Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free
    kits, and the KAPA Biosystems Hyper Prep PCR and PCR-free systems.
    Significant differences in taxonomy are observed among the four
    different next-generation sequencing library preparations using a
    DNA mock community and a cell control of known concentration. We
    also revealed biases in error profiles, duplication rates, and
    loss of reads representing organisms that have a high \%G+C
    content that can significantly impact results. As with all
    methods, the use of benchmarking controls has revealed critical
    differences among methods that impact sequencing results and later
    would impact study interpretation. We recommend that the community
    adopt PCR-free-based approaches to reduce PCR bias that affects
    calculations of abundance and to improve assemblies for accurate
    taxonomic assignment. Furthermore, the inclusion of a known-input
    cell spike-in control provides accurate quantitation of organisms
    in clinical samples.},

    achieved with a silica solid phase extraction column in the
    presence of a chaotrope. Versions of these protocols have been
    adapted for point of care (POC) diagnostic devices in miniaturized
    platforms, but commercial kits require a high amount of input DNA.
    Thus, when the input clinical sample contains less than 1 μg of
    total DNA, the target-specific DNA recovery from most of these
    protocols is low without supplementing the sample with exogenous
    carrier DNA. In fact, many clinical samples used in the
    development of POC diagnostics often exhibit target DNA
    concentrations as low as 3 ng/mL. With the broader goal of
    improving the yield and efficiency of nucleic acid-based POC
    devices for dilute samples, we investigated both DNA adsorption
    and recovery from silica particles by using 1 pg– 1 μg of DNA with
    a set of adsorption and elution buffers ranging in pH and
    chaotropic presence. In terms of adsorption, we found that low pH
    and the presence of chaotropic guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN)
    enhanced DNA-silica adsorption. When eluting with a standard
    low-salt, high-pH buffer, {$>$} 70\% of DNA was unrecoverable,
    except when DNA was initially adsorbed with 5 M GuSCN at pH 5.2.
    Unrecovered DNA was either not initially adsorbed or irreversibly
    bound on the silica surface. Recovery was improved when eluting
    with 95°C formamide and 1 M NaOH, which suggested that
    DNA-silica-chaotrope interactions are dominated by hydrophobic
    interactions and hydrogen bonding. While heated formamide and NaOH
    are non-ideal elution buffers for practical POC devices, the
    salient results are important for engineering a set of optimized
    reagents that could maximize nucleic acid recovery from a

  abstract     = {SusG is an α-amylase and part of a large protein
    complex on the outer surface of the bacterial cell and plays a
    major role in carbohydrate acquisition by the animal gut
    microbiota. Presented here, the atomic structure of SusG has an
    unusual extended, bilobed structure composed of amylase at one end
    and an unprecedented internal carbohydrate-binding motif at the
    other. Structural studies further demonstrate that the
    carbohydrate-binding motif binds maltooligosaccharide distal to,
    and on the opposite side of, the amylase catalytic site. SusG has
    an additional starch-binding site on the amylase domain
    immediately adjacent to the active cleft. Mutagenesis analysis
    demonstrates that these two additional starch-binding sites appear
    to play a role in catabolism of insoluble starch. However,
    elimination of these sites has only a limited effect, suggesting
    that they may have a more important role in product exchange with
    other Sus components. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

    the experimental landscape of microbial ecology. In the last 10
    years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA
    gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing
    of millions of fragments per study using next-generation
    sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these
    technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths,
    weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the
    interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an
    improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S
    rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently
    capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated
    three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length
    (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and
    natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By
    titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to
    the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct
    discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were
    able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude.
    Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to
    demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and
    sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses
    demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least
    as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing
    considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the
    cost.},

    but many types of bacteria are still uncharacterized. Moreover,
    reference strains of mouse gut bacteria are not easily available,
    although mouse models are extensively used in medical research.
    These are major limitations for the investigation of intestinal
    microbiomes and their interactions with diet and host. It is thus
    important to study in detail the diversity and functions of gut
    microbiota members, including those colonizing the mouse
    intestine. To address these issues, we aimed at establishing the
    Mouse Intestinal Bacterial Collection (miBC), a public repository
    of bacterial strains and associated genomes from the mouse gut,
    and studied host-specificity of colonization and sequence-based
    relevance of the resource. The collection includes several strains
    representing novel species, genera and even one family. Genomic
    analyses showed that certain species are specific to the mouse
    intestine and that a minimal consortium of 18 strains covered
    50-75\% of the known functional potential of metagenomes. The
    present work will sustain future research on microbiota-host

    selectively targeted for dideoxynucleotide-terminated sequencing

    Three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to
    the three major 16S rRNA structural domains, routinely yield
    800-1000 nucleotides of 16S rRNA sequence. The method is evaluated
    with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in
    the template RNA, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of
    several 16S rRNAs whose gene sequences are known. The relative

    numbers for any collection of entries selected. Curation tools now

  abstract     = {Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an
    effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection
    and shows promise for treating other medical conditions associated
    with intestinal dysbioses. However, we lack a sufficient
    understanding of which microbial populations successfully colonize
    the recipient gut, and the widely used approaches to study the
    microbial ecology of FMT experiments fail to provide enough
    resolution to identify populations that are likely responsible for
    FMT-derived benefits. We used shotgun metagenomics together with
    assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct
    metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from fecal samples of a single
    FMT donor. We then used metagenomic mapping to track the
    occurrence and distribution patterns of donor MAGs in two FMT
    recipients. Our analyses revealed that 22\% of the 92 highly
    complete bacterial MAGs that we identified from the donor
    successfully colonized and remained abundant in two recipients for
    at least 8~weeks. Most MAGs with a high colonization rate belonged
    to the order Bacteroidales. The vast majority of those that lacked
    evidence of colonization belonged to the order Clostridiales, and
    colonization success was negatively correlated with the number of
    genes related to sporulation. Our analysis of 151 publicly
    available gut metagenomes showed that the donor MAGs that
    colonized both recipients were prevalent, and the ones that
    colonized neither were rare across the participants of the Human
    Microbiome Project. Although our dataset showed a link between
    taxonomy and the colonization ability of a given MAG, we also
    identified MAGs that belong to the same taxon with different
    colonization properties, highlighting the importance of an
    appropriate level of resolution to explore the functional basis of
    colonization and to identify targets for cultivation, hypothesis
    generation, and testing in model systems. The analytical strategy
    adopted in our study can provide genomic insights into bacterial
    populations that may be critical to the efficacy of FMT due to
    their success in gut colonization and metabolic properties, and
    guide cultivation efforts to investigate mechanistic underpinnings
    of this procedure beyond associations.},

  abstract     = {Summary Microorganisms play critical roles in human
    health and disease. They live in diverse communities in which they
    interact synergistically or antagonistically. Thus for estimating
    microbial associations with clinical covariates, such as treatment
    effects, joint (multivariate) statistical models are preferred.
    Multivariate models allow one to estimate and exploit complex
    interdependencies among multiple taxa, yielding more powerful
    tests of exposure or treatment effects than application of
    taxon-specific univariate analyses. Analysis of microbial count
    data also requires special attention because data commonly exhibit
    zero inflation, i.e., more zeros than expected from a standard
    count distribution. To meet these needs, we developed a Bayesian
    variable selection model for multivariate count data with excess
    zeros that incorporates information on the covariance structure of
    the outcomes (counts for multiple taxa), while estimating
    associations with the mean levels of these outcomes. Though there
    has been much work on zero-inflated models for longitudinal data,
    little attention has been given to high-dimensional multivariate
    zero-inflated data modeled via a general correlation structure.
    Through simulation, we compared performance of the proposed method
    to that of existing univariate approaches, for both the binary
    (“excess zero”) and count parts of the model. When outcomes were
    correlated the proposed variable selection method maintained type
    I error while boosting the ability to identify true associations
    in the binary component of the model. For the count part of the
    model, in some scenarios the univariate method had higher power
    than the multivariate approach. This higher power was at a cost of
    a highly inflated false discovery rate not observed with the
    proposed multivariate method. We applied the approach to oral
    microbiome data from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Oral Health
    Study and identified five (of 44) species associated with HIV
    infection.},

    disrupts homeostatic gut-liver axis function and is essential in
    the development of alcoholic liver disease. Here, we investigate
    changes in enteric microbiome composition in a model of early
    alcoholic steatohepatitis and dissect the pathogenic role of
    intestinal microbes in alcohol-induced liver pathology. Materials
    and methods Wild type mice received a 10-day diet that was either
    5\% alcohol-containing or an isocaloric control diet plus a single
    binge. 16S rDNA sequencing defined the bacterial communities in
    the cecum of alcohol- and pair-fed animals. Some mice were treated
    with an antibiotic cocktail prior to and throughout alcohol
    feeding. Liver neutrophils, cytokines and steatosis were
    evaluated. Results Acute-on-chronic alcohol administration induced
    shifts in various bacterial phyla in the cecum, including
    increased Actinobacteria and a reduction in Verrucomicrobia driven
    entirely by a reduction in the genus Akkermansia. Antibiotic
    treatment reduced the gut bacterial load and circulating bacterial
    wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that bacterial
    load suppression prevented alcohol-related increases in the number
    of myeloperoxidase-(MPO) positive infiltrating neutrophils in the
    liver. Expression of liver mRNA tumor necrosis factor alpha
    (Tnfα), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (Cxcl1) and circulating
    protein monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were also
    reduced in antibiotic-treated alcohol-fed mice. Alcohol-induced
    hepatic steatosis measured by Oil-Red O staining was significantly
    reduced in antibiotic treated mice. Genes regulating lipid
    production and storage were also altered by alcohol and antibiotic
    treatment. Interestingly, antibiotic treatment did not protect
    from alcohol-induced increases in serum aminotransferases
    (ALT/AST). Conclusions Our data indicate that acute-on-chronic
    alcohol feeding alters the microflora at multiple taxonomic levels
    and identifies loss of Akkermansia as an early marker of
    alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis. We conclude that gut microbes
    influence liver inflammation, neutrophil infiltration and liver
    steatosis following alcohol consumption and these data further
    emphasize the role of the gut-liver axis in early alcoholic liver

  abstract     = {Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) formation by
    intestinal bacteria is regulated by many different host,
    environmental, dietary and microbiological factors. In broad
    terms, however, substrate availability, bacterial species
    composition of the microbiota and intestinal transit time largely
    determine the amounts and types of SCFA that are produced in
    healthy individuals. The majority of SCFA in the gut are derived
    from bacterial breakdown of complex carbohydrates, especially in
    the proximal bowel, but digestion of proteins and peptides makes
    an increasing contribution to SCFA production as food residues
    pass through the bowel. Bacterial hydrogen metabolism also affects
    the way in which SCFA are made. This outcome can be seen through
    the effects of inorganic electron acceptors (nitrate, sulfate) on
    fermentation processes, where they facilitate the formation of
    more oxidised SCFA such as acetate, at the expense of more reduced
    fatty acids, such as butyrate. Chemostat studies using pure
    cultures of saccharolytic gut micro-organisms demonstrate that C
    availability and growth rate strongly affect the outcome of
    fermentation. For example, acetate and formate are the major
    bifidobacterial fermentation products formed during growth under C
    limitation, whereas acetate and lactate are produced when
    carbohydrate is in excess. Lactate is also used as an electron
    sink in Clostridium perfringens and, to a lesser extent, in
    Bacteroides fragilis. In the latter organism acetate and succinate
    are the major fermentation products when substrate is abundant,
    whereas succinate is decarboxylated to produce propionate when C
    and energy sources are limiting.},

    determined. An analysis of key enzymes of possible pathways was
    also made. The results of the labeling experiments showed that:
    (i) B. fragilis ferments glucose via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway;
    and (ii) there was a randomization of carbons 1, 2, and 6 of
    glucose during conversion to propionate, which is in accordance
    with propionate formation via fumarate and succinate. The enzymes
    6-phosphofrucktokinase (pyrophosphate-dependent),
    fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, phosphoenolpyruvate
    carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, and
    methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase could be demonstrated in cell
    extracts. Their presence supported the labeling results and
    suggested that propionate is formed from succinate via succinyl-,
    methylmalonyl-, and propionyl-coenzyme A. From the results it also
    is clear that CO(2) is necessary for growth because it is needed
    for the formation of C4 acids. There was also a randomization of
    carbons 1, 2, and 6 of glucose during conversion to acetate, which
    indicated that pyruvate kinase played a minor role in pyruvate
    formation from phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphoenolpyruvate
    carboxykinase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, and malic enzyme
    (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent) were
    present in cell extracts of B. fragilis, and the results of the

    oxaloacetate and malate if these acids are in equilibrium with
    fumarate. The conversion of [2-(14)C]- and [3-(14)C]lactate to

    Makinoshima, A. Nishimura, and A. Ishihama, Mol. Microbiol.

    at an early step for a mutant E. coli with the disrupted rpoS

    stationary-phase gene transcription. This finding suggests that
    RpoS is need for the entire process of cell density increase. In
    the absence of RpoF sigma factor, the flagella are not formed as
    observed by electron microscopy, but the growth phase-coupled
    density increase takes place as in wild-type E. coli, confirming
    that the alteration in cell density is not directly correlated
    with the presence or absence of flagella. In the stationary-phase
    cells, accumulation of electron-dense areas was observed by
    electron microscopic observation of bacterial thin sections. By
    chemical determination, the increase in glycogen (or

  abstract     = {Background: Understanding the factors regulating our
    microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical
    methodology.When comparing two or more populations most existing
    approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure
    in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the
    multi- nomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may
    impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data.
    Objective: To develop a methodology that accounts for
    compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting
    differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while
    maintaining high statistical power. Methods: We introduced a novel
    statistical framework called analysis of composition of
    microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure
    in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of
    microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no
    distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear
    model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model
    longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples
    involving thousands of taxa. Results: We compared the performance
    of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published
    methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1)
    for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more
    populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at
    the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the
    t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as
    68\% for the t-test and 60\% for ZIG.We illustrate the performance
    of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the
    human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing
    hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial
    communities. Conclusion: Accounting for compositionality using
    log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in
    microbiota survey data.},

    Bifidobacterium and Bacteriodes, and a concurrent reduction in
    SCFAs. Moreover, increased intake of fermentable dietary fibre, or
    SCFAs, seems to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of
    colitis. SCFAs bind the G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43, also
    known as FFAR2), and here we show that SCFA-GPR43 interactions
    profoundly affect inflammatory responses. Stimulation of GPR43 by
    SCFAs was necessary for the normal resolution of certain
    inflammatory responses, because GPR43-deficient (Gpr43(-/-)) mice
    showed exacerbated or unresolving inflammation in models of
    colitis, arthritis and asthma. This seemed to relate to increased
    production of inflammatory mediators by Gpr43(-/-) immune cells,
    and increased immune cell recruitment. Germ-free mice, which are
    devoid of bacteria and express little or no SCFAs, showed a
    similar dysregulation of certain inflammatory responses. GPR43
    binding of SCFAs potentially provides a molecular link between
    diet, gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism, and immune and
    inflammatory responses.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Chronic low-grade inflammation is
    recognized as an important factor contributing to senescence and
    age-related diseases. In mammals, levels of polyamines (PAs)
    decrease during the ageing process; PAs are known to decrease
    systemic inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine
    synthesis in macrophages. Reductions in intestinal luminal PAs
    levels have been associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction.
    The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LKM512
    is known to increase intestinal luminal PA concentrations.
    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We supplemented the diet of
    10-month-old Crj:CD-1 female mice with LKM512 for 11 months, while
    the controls received no supplementation. Survival rates were
    compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. LKM512-treated mice
    survived significantly longer than controls (P{$<$}0.001);
    moreover, skin ulcers and tumors were more common in the control
    mice. We then analyzed inflammatory and intestinal conditions by
    measuring several markers using HPLC, ELISA, reverse
    transcription-quantitative PCR, and histological slices. LKM512
    mice showed altered 16S rRNA gene expression of several
    predominant intestinal bacterial groups. The fecal concentrations
    of PAs, but not of short-chain fatty acids, were significantly
    higher in LKM512-treated mice (P{$<$}0.05). Colonic mucosal
    function was also better in LKM512 mice, with increased mucus
    secretion and better maintenance of tight junctions. Changes in
    gene expression levels were evaluated using the NimbleGen mouse
    DNA microarray. LKM512 administration also downregulated the
    expression of ageing-associated and inflammation-associated genes
    and gene expression levels in 21-month-old LKM512-treated mice
    resembled those in 10-month-old untreated (younger) mice.
    CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated increased
    longevity in mice following probiotic treatment with LKM512,
    possibly due to the suppression of chronic low-grade inflammation
    in the colon induced by higher PA levels. This indicates that
    ingestion of specific probiotics may be an easy approach for
    improving intestinal health and increasing lifespan. Further
    studies are required to clarify its effectiveness in humans.},

  abstract     = {Animal models have historically played a critical
    role in the exploration and characterization of disease
    pathophysiology, target identification, and in the in vivo
    evaluation of novel therapeutic agents and treatments. In the wake
    of numerous clinical trial failures of new chemical entities
    (NCEs) with promising preclinical profiles, animal models in all
    therapeutic areas have been increasingly criticized for their
    limited ability to predict NCE efficacy, safety and toxicity in
    humans. The present review discusses some of the challenges
    associated with the evaluation and predictive validation of animal
    models, as well as methodological flaws in both preclinical and
    clinical study designs that may contribute to the current
    translational failure rate. The testing of disease hypotheses and
    NCEs in multiple disease models necessitates evaluation of
    pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships and the
    earlier development of validated disease-associated biomarkers to
    assess target engagement and NCE efficacy. Additionally, the
    transparent integration of efficacy and safety data derived from
    animal models into the hierarchical data sets generated
    preclinically is essential in order to derive a level of
    predictive utility consistent with the degree of validation and
    inherent limitations of current animal models. The predictive
    value of an animal model is thus only as useful as the context in
    which it is interpreted. Finally, rather than dismissing animal
    models as not very useful in the drug discovery process,
    additional resources, like those successfully used in the
    preclinical PK assessment used for the selection of lead NCEs,
    must be focused on improving existing and developing new animal

    count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently
    historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple
    proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use
    rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are
    inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species.
    Well-established statistical theory is available that
    simultaneously accounts for library size differences and
    biological variability using an appropriate mixture model.
    Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count
    data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already
    available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq.
    Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use
    simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial
    improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over
    simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and
    rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests
    for species that are differentially abundant across sample
    classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show
    that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be
    accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare
    different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described
    zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called
    metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there
    is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it
    nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on
    these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate
    that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided

    Pairwise comparisons of the nine extraction procedures revealed

    Neither lysozyme digestion before SDS treatment nor guanidine

    the DNA yields. Bead mill homogenization in a lysis mixture

    was found to be the best physical lysis technique when DNA yield
    and cell lysis efficiency were used as criteria. The bead mill

    Inulin is a widely used model prebiotic dietary fiber.
    Inconsistent reports on the effects of inulin on cholesterol

    clarify this issue, the present study aimed to provide an in-depth

    long-chain (lc)- inulin on cholesterol synthesis, absorption and
    elimination in mice. Feeding wildtype C57BL/6J mice diets
    supplemented with 10\% (w/w) of either sc- or lc-inulin for two
    weeks resulted in approximately 2.5-fold higher fecal SCFA levels
    (P\,{$<$}\,0.01) compared with controls, but had no significant
    effects on plasma and liver lipids. Subtle shifts in fecal and
    plasma bile acid species were detected with beta-muricholic acid
    increasing significantly in plasma of the inulin fed groups

    lc-inulin affected intestinal cholesterol absorption, mass fecal
    cholesterol excretion or trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion

    no adverse effects on cholesterol metabolism in mice despite

    substrates presents a promising route of biological hydrogen
    production compared with photosynthetic or chemical routes. Pure
    substrates, including glucose, starch and cellulose, as well as
    different organic waste materials can be used for hydrogen
    fermentation. Among a large number of microbial species, strict
    anaerobes and facultative anaerobic chemoheterotrophs, such as
    clostridia and enteric bacteria, are efficient producers of
    hydrogen. Despite having a higher evolution rate of hydrogen, the
    yield of hydrogen [mol H2 (mol substrate(-1))] from fermentative
    processes is lower than that achieved using other methods; thus,
    the process is not economically viable in its present form. The
    pathways and experimental evidence cited in the literature reveal
    that a maximum of four mol of hydrogen can be obtained from
    substrates such as glucose. Modifications of the fermentation
    process, by redirection of metabolic pathways, gas sparging and
    maintaining a low partial pressure of hydrogen to make the
    reaction thermodynamically favorable, efficient product removal,
    optimum bioreactor design and integrating fermentative process
    with that of photosynthesis, are some of the ways that have been
    attempted to improve hydrogen productivity. This review briefly

    bacterial proteins. However, the evolutionary relationship of the
    genes encoding proteins of this family remains unclear, as well as
    their distribution among main groups of the living
    organisms.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The extensive
    search of the current databases allowed us to double the number of
    GH97 family proteins. Five subfamilies were distinguished on the
    basis of pairwise sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis.
    Iterative sequence analysis revealed the relationship of the GH97
    family with the GH27, GH31, and GH36 families of glycosidases,

    results of this study show an unexpected sequence similarity of
    GH97 family proteins with glycoside hydrolases from several other
    families, that have (beta/alpha)8-barrel fold of the catalytic
    domain and a retaining mechanism of the glycoside bond hydrolysis.
    These data suggest a common evolutionary origin of glycosidases

    attention owing to its association with a wide range of diseases,
    ranging from metabolic disorders (e.g. obesity and type 2
    diabetes) to autoimmune diseases (such as inflammatory bowel
    disease and type 1 diabetes), cancer and even neurodevelopmental
    disorders (e.g. autism). Having been increasingly used in
    biomedical research, mice have become the model of choice for most
    studies in this emerging field. Mouse models allow perturbations
    in gut microbiota to be studied in a controlled experimental
    setup, and thus help in assessing causality of the complex
    host-microbiota interactions and in developing mechanistic
    hypotheses. However, pitfalls should be considered when
    translating gut microbiome research results from mouse models to
    humans. In this Special Article, we discuss the intrinsic
    similarities and differences that exist between the two systems,
    and compare the human and murine core gut microbiota based on a
    meta-analysis of currently available datasets. Finally, we discuss
    the external factors that influence the capability of mouse models
    to recapitulate the gut microbiota shifts associated with human
    diseases, and investigate which alternative model systems exist

    but only a small fraction of this diversity grows on artificial
    media. This phenomenon was noticed almost a century ago,
    repeatedly confirmed, and termed the "great plate count anomaly."
    Advances in microbial cultivation improved microbial recovery but
    failed to explain why most microbial species do not grow in vitro.
    Here we show that at least some of such species can form
    domesticated variants capable of growth on artificial media. We
    also present evidence that small signaling molecules, such as
    short peptides, may be essential factors in initiating growth of
    nongrowing cells. We identified one 5-amino-acid peptide, LQPEV,
    that at 3.5 nM induces the otherwise "uncultivable" strain
    Psychrobacter sp. strain MSC33 to grow on standard media. This
    demonstrates that the restriction preventing microbial in vitro
    growth may be different from those offered to date to explain the
    "great plate count anomaly," such as deficiencies in nutrient
    composition and concentrations in standard media, medium toxicity,
    and inappropriate incubation time. Growth induction of MSC33
    illustrates that some microorganisms do not grow in vitro because
    they are removed from their native communities and the signals
    produced therein. "Uncultivable" species represent the largest
    source of unexplored biodiversity, and provide remarkable
    opportunities for both basic and applied research. Access to
    cultures of some of these species should be possible through
    identification of the signaling compounds necessary for growth,
    their addition to standard medium formulations, and eventual
    domestication.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND Our view of host-associated microbiota
    remains incomplete due to the presence of as yet uncultured
    constituents. The Bacteroidales family S24-7 is a prominent
    example of one of these groups. Marker gene surveys indicate that
    members of this family are highly localized to the
    gastrointestinal tracts of homeothermic animals and are
    increasingly being recognized as a numerically predominant member
    of the gut microbiota; however, little is known about the nature
    of their interactions with the host. RESULTS Here, we provide the
    first whole genome exploration of this family, for which we
    propose the name "Candidatus Homeothermaceae," using 30 population
    genomes extracted from fecal samples of four different animal
    hosts: human, mouse, koala, and guinea pig. We infer the core
    metabolism of "Ca. Homeothermaceae" to be that of fermentative or
    nanaerobic bacteria, resembling that of related Bacteroidales
    families. In addition, we describe three trophic guilds within the
    family, plant glycan (hemicellulose and pectin), host glycan, and
    α-glucan, each broadly defined by increased abundance of enzymes
    involved in the degradation of particular carbohydrates.
    CONCLUSIONS "Ca. Homeothermaceae" representatives constitute a
    substantial component of the murine gut microbiota, as well as
    being present within the human gut, and this study provides
    important first insights into the nature of their residency. The
    presence of trophic guilds within the family indicates the
    potential for niche partitioning and specific roles for each guild
    in gut health and dysbiosis.},

    is providing key information regarding the evolutionary and

    for assessing the quality of a genome using a broader set of

    reference genome tree and information about the collocation of
    these genes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CheckM using

    metagenome derived genomes. CheckM is shown to provide accurate
    estimates of genome completeness and contamination, and to
    outperform existing approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a
    diverse range of errors currently impacting publicly available
    isolate genomes and demonstrate that genomes obtained from single
    cells and metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order

  abstract     = {As 16S rRNA gene targeted massively parallel
    sequencing has become a common tool for microbial diversity
    investigations, numerous advances have been made to minimize the
    influence of sequencing and chimeric PCR artifacts through
    rigorous quality control measures. However, there has been little
    effort towards understanding the effect of multi-template PCR
    biases on microbial community structure. In this study, we used
    three bacterial and three archaeal mock communities consisting of,
    respectively, 33 bacterial and 24 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences
    combined in different proportions to compare the influences of (1)
    sequencing depth, (2) sequencing artifacts (sequencing errors and
    chimeric PCR artifacts), and (3) biases in multi-template PCR,
    towards the interpretation of community structure in
    pyrosequencing datasets. We also assessed the influence of each of
    these three variables on α- and β-diversity metrics that rely on
    the number of OTUs alone (richness) and those that include both
    membership and the relative abundance of detected OTUs
    (diversity). As part of this study, we redesigned bacterial and
    archaeal primer sets that target the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA
    gene, along with multiplexing barcodes, to permit simultaneous
    sequencing of PCR products from the two domains. We conclude that
    the benefits of deeper sequencing efforts extend beyond greater
    OTU detection and result in higher precision in β-diversity
    analyses by reducing the variability between replicate libraries,
    despite the presence of more sequencing artifacts. Additionally,
    spurious OTUs resulting from sequencing errors have a significant
    impact on richness or shared-richness based α- and β-diversity
    metrics, whereas metrics that utilize community structure
    (including both richness and relative abundance of OTUs) are
    minimally affected by spurious OTUs. However, the greatest
    obstacle towards accurately evaluating community structure are the
    errors in estimated mean relative abundance of each detected OTU
    due to biases associated with multi-template PCR reactions.},

    for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of
    thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree
    that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.
    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Where FastTree 1 used
    nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution
    criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution
    subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs.
    FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees
    and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the "CAT"
    approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine
    alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard
    implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default
    settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods
    that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree
    are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is
    100-1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and
    likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S
    ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes
    of memory. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: FastTree 2 allows the
    inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments.

    Correlating shifts in the relative abundances of bacterial taxa

    semi-quantitative by definition, the observed dynamics may not

    combined the sequencing approach (16S rRNA gene) with robust
    single-cell enumeration technologies (flow cytometry) to quantify
    the absolute taxon abundances. A detailed longitudinal analysis of
    the absolute abundances resulted in distinct abundance profiles
    that were less ambiguous and expressed in units that can be
    directly compared across studies. We further provide evidence that
    the enrichment of taxa (increase in relative abundance) does not
    necessarily relate to the outgrowth of taxa (increase in absolute
    abundance). Our results highlight that both relative and absolute
    abundances should be considered for a comprehensive biological

    sequence of a human commensal E. coli isolate, E. coli HS, which
    will undoubtedly provide a new baseline from which workers can
    examine the evolution of pathogenic E. coli. Comparison of 17 E.
    coli genomes, 8 of which are new, resulted in identification of
    approximately 2,200 genes conserved in all isolates. We were also
    able to identify genes that were isolate and pathovar specific.
    Fewer pathovar-specific genes were identified than anticipated,
    suggesting that each isolate may have independently developed
    virulence capabilities. Pangenome calculations indicate that E.
    coli genomic diversity represents an open pangenome model
    containing a reservoir of more than 13,000 genes, many of which
    may be uncharacterized but important virulence factors. This
    comparative study of the species E. coli, while descriptive,
    should provide the basis for future functional work on this
    important group of pathogens.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a
    predominant member of the human gut microbiota, is characterized
    by its ability to utilize a wide variety of polysaccharides using
    the extensive saccharolytic machinery that is controlled by an
    expanded repertoire of transcription factors (TFs). The
    availability of genomic sequences for multiple Bacteroides species
    opens an opportunity for their comparative analysis to enable
    characterization of their metabolic and regulatory networks.
    RESULTS A comparative genomics approach was applied for the
    reconstruction and functional annotation of the carbohydrate
    utilization regulatory networks in 11 Bacteroides genomes.
    Bioinformatics analysis of promoter regions revealed putative
    DNA-binding motifs and regulons for 31 orthologous TFs in the
    Bacteroides. Among the analyzed TFs there are 4 SusR-like
    regulators, 16 AraC-like hybrid two-component systems (HTCSs), and
    11 regulators from other families. Novel DNA motifs of HTCSs and
    SusR-like regulators in the Bacteroides have the common structure
    of direct repeats with a long spacer between two conserved sites.
    CONCLUSIONS The inferred regulatory network in B. thetaiotaomicron
    contains 308 genes encoding polysaccharide and sugar catabolic
    enzymes, carbohydrate-binding and transport systems, and TFs. The
    analyzed TFs control pathways for utilization of host and dietary
    glycans to monosaccharides and their further interconversions to
    intermediates of the central metabolism. The reconstructed
    regulatory network allowed us to suggest and refine specific
    functional assignments for sugar catabolic enzymes and
    transporters, providing a substantial improvement to the existing
    metabolic models for B. thetaiotaomicron. The obtained collection
    of reconstructed TF regulons is available in the RegPrecise
    database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov).},

    by microbial fermentation and may help maintain human health. We
    have examined the distribution of three different pathways used by
    bacteria for propionate formation using genomic and metagenomic
    analysis of the human gut microbiota and by designing degenerate
    primer sets for the detection of diagnostic genes for these
    pathways. Degenerate primers for the acrylate pathway (detecting
    the lcdA gene, encoding lactoyl-CoA dehydratase) together with
    metagenomic mining revealed that this pathway is restricted to
    only a few human colonic species within the Lachnospiraceae and
    Negativicutes. The operation of this pathway for lactate
    utilisation in Coprococcus catus (Lachnospiraceae) was confirmed
    using stable isotope labelling. The propanediol pathway that
    processes deoxy sugars such as fucose and rhamnose was more
    abundant within the Lachnospiraceae (based on the pduP gene, which
    encodes propionaldehyde dehydrogenase), occurring in relatives of
    Ruminococcus obeum and in Roseburia inulinivorans. The dominant
    source of propionate from hexose sugars, however, was concluded to
    be the succinate pathway, as indicated by the widespread
    distribution of the mmdA gene that encodes methylmalonyl-CoA
    decarboxylase in the Bacteroidetes and in many Negativicutes. In
    general, the capacity to produce propionate or butyrate from
    hexose sugars resided in different species, although two species
    of Lachnospiraceae (C. catus and R. inulinivorans) are now known
    to be able to switch from butyrate to propionate production on
    different substrates. A better understanding of the microbial
    ecology of short-chain fatty acid formation may allow modulation
    of propionate formation by the human gut microbiota.},

    continues to increase in incidence and severity, and was the most
    common nosocomial infection in the USA in 2010. Most cases of CDI
    respond to a standard course of antibiotics, but recurrent C.
    difficile infection (RCDI) has become increasingly frequent, and
    alternative treatments are needed. We examined the efficacy of
    fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) instilled into the upper
    gastrointestinal tract for RCDI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
    medical records for all patients treated with FMT during a 9-year
    period at a single institution in northern Minnesota were reviewed
    retrospectively. Eighty-nine FMT courses were provided by
    nasogastric tube to 87 patients, and demographic and clinical data
    were abstracted, including details of treatments prior to FMT,
    rate of FMT treatment success and clinical course during a 60-day
    post FMT follow up period. Fourteen FMT courses failed to meet
    criteria for inclusion. RESULTS: Each patient served as their own
    control, having failed standard treatment. After exclusions, the
    case series included 75 FMT courses administered to 74 patients.
    Fifty-nine FMT courses resulted in clinical resolution of diarrhea
    for a primary cure rate of 79\%. Diarrhea relapsed following 16
    FMT courses; in 9 of these cases diarrhea subsequently resolved
    after a single course of vancomycin. No adverse events were noted.
    CONCLUSIONS: Our findings parallel findings from other studies
    when FMT has been provided via the upper GI tract, and suggest
    that patients with recurrent CDI may resolve diarrhea by
    introducing stool from healthy donors into the upper GI tract via
    nasogastric tube.},

    the authors named 'mouse intestinal bacteria'. 16S rRNA probes
    were developed for this new OTU. Upon analysis of the novel
    sequences, eight were found to cluster within the Eubacterium
    rectale-Clostridium coccoides group and three clustered within the
    Bacteroides group. One of the novel sequences was distantly
    related to Verrucomicrobium spinosum and one was distantly related
    to Bacillus mycoides. Oligonucleotide probes specific for the 16S
    rRNA of these novel clones were generated. Using a combination of
    four previously described and four newly designed probes,
    approximately 80\% of bacteria recovered from the murine large
    intestine and 71\% of bacteria recovered from the murine caecum
    could be identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).},

    influence to the brain via various pathways connecting the gut to
    the central nervous system. While understanding and appreciation
    of a gut microbial impact on neurological function is nascent,

    are ligands for Gpr41, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed by a
    subset of enteroendocrine cells in the gut epithelium. To examine
    the contribution of Gpr41 to energy balance, we compared Gpr41-/-
    and Gpr41+/+ mice that were either conventionally-raised with a
    complete gut microbiota or were reared germ-free and then
    cocolonized as young adults with two prominent members of the
    human distal gut microbial community: the saccharolytic bacterium,

    Methanobrevibacter smithii. Both conventionally-raised and
    gnotobiotic Gpr41-/- mice colonized with the model fermentative

    (+/+) littermates, despite similar levels of chow consumption.
    These differences are not evident when germ-free WT and germ-free
    Gpr41 knockout animals are compared. Functional genomic,
    biochemical, and physiologic studies of germ-free and cocolonized
    Gpr41-/- and +/+ littermates disclosed that Gpr41-deficiency is
    associated with reduced expression of PYY, an enteroendocrine
    cell-derived hormone that normally inhibits gut motility,
    increased intestinal transit rate, and reduced harvest of energy
    (short-chain fatty acids) from the diet. These results reveal that

    Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, and Dynamic Unigram models. To
    develop guidelines for when different methods are appropriate, we

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The 99\% of bacteria in the environment
    that are recalcitrant to culturing have spurred the development of
    metagenomics, a culture-independent approach to sample and
    characterize microbial genomes. Massive datasets of metagenomic
    sequences have been accumulated, but analysis of these sequences
    has focused primarily on the descriptive comparison of the
    relative abundance of proteins that belong to specific functional
    categories. More robust statistical methods are needed to make
    inferences from metagenomic data. In this study, we developed and
    applied a suite of tools to describe and compare the richness,
    membership, and structure of microbial communities using peptide
    fragment sequences extracted from metagenomic sequence data.
    RESULTS: Application of these tools to acid mine drainage, soil,
    and whale fall metagenomic sequence collections revealed groups of
    peptide fragments with a relatively high abundance and no known
    function. When combined with analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments
    from the same communities these tools enabled us to demonstrate
    that although there was no overlap in the types of 16S rRNA gene
    sequence observed, there was a core collection of operational
    protein families that was shared among the three environments.
    CONCLUSION: The results of comparisons between the three habitats
    were surprising considering the relatively low overlap of
    membership and the distinctively different characteristics of the
    three habitats. These tools will facilitate the use of
    metagenomics to pursue statistically sound genome-based ecological
    analyses.},

    establish the identities of the picoplankton by comparison with an
    established data base of rRNA sequences. Fifteen unique
    eubacterial sequences were obtained, including four from
    cyanobacteria and eleven from proteobacteria. A single eucaryote
    related to dinoflagellates was identified; no archaebacterial
    sequences were detected. The cyanobacterial sequences are all
    closely related to sequences from cultivated marine Synechococcus
    strains and with cyanobacterial sequences obtained from the
    Atlantic Ocean (Sargasso Sea). Several sequences were related to
    common marine isolates of the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria.
    In addition to sequences closely related to those of described
    bacteria, sequences were obtained from two phylogenetic groups of
    organisms that are not closely related to any known rRNA sequences
    from cultivated organisms. Both of these novel phylogenetic
    clusters are proteobacteria, one group within the alpha
    subdivision and the other distinct from known proteobacterial
    subdivisions. The rRNA sequences of the alpha-related group are
    nearly identical to those of some Sargasso Sea picoplankton,
    suggesting a global distribution of these organisms.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Mechanistic data to support health
    claims is often generated using rodent models, and the influence
    of prebiotic supplementation has largely been evaluated using male
    rodents. Given that sex-based differences in immune parameters are
    well recognized and recent evidence suggests differences in
    microbiota composition between sexes, validation of the
    effectiveness of prebiotics merits assessment in both males and
    females. Here, we have compared the effect of oligofructose (OF)
    supplementation on the fecal bacterial community, short chain
    fatty acid profiles, and gut mucosal and systemic immune
    parameters in male and female rats.\textbackslash n\textbackslash
    nMETHODS: Male and female rats were fed rodent chow or chow
    supplemented with OF (5 \% w/w). Fecal community change was
    examined by analyzing 16S rRNA gene content. To compare effects of
    OF between sexes at the gut microbial and mucosal immune level,
    fecal short chain fatty acid and tissue cytokine profiles were
    measured. Serum lipopolysaccharide levels were also evaluated by
    the limulus amebocyte lysate assay as an indirect means of
    determining gut permeability between sexes.\textbackslash
    n\textbackslash nRESULTS: In the fecal community of females, OF
    supplementation altered community structure by increasing
    abundance in the Phylum Bacteroidetes. In male rats, no changes in
    fecal community structure were observed, although fecal butyrate
    levels significantly increased. Liver Immunoglobulin A (IgA)
    levels were higher in males relative to females fed OF, and serum
    LPS concentrations were higher in males independent of diet.
    Females had higher basal levels of the regulatory cytokine
    interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the colon and liver, while males had
    higher basal levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and
    cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) in the
    cecum and liver.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: We
    have shown that male and female rat gut communities metabolize an
    OF-supplemented diet differently. Sex-specific responses in both
    the fecal community and systemic immune parameters suggest that
    this difference may result from an increase in the availability of
    gut peptidyl-nitrogen in the males. These findings demonstrate the
    importance of performing sex-comparative studies when
    investigating potential health effects of prebiotics using rodent

    cecal SCFA or gut microbial composition. Dietary SCFAs suppressed
    hepatic weight and lipid synthesis. These effects were abolished
    in FFAR3-deficient mice but not FFAR2-deficient. Thus, SCFAs

    Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron utilizes starch by binding the
    polysaccharide to the bacterial surface and subsequently degrading
    the polymer by using cell-associated enzymes. Most of the
    starch-degrading activity was localized to the periplasm, but a
    portion appeared to be membrane associated. This raised the
    possibility that some breakdown might occur in the outer membrane
    prior to exposure of the polysaccharide to the periplasmic
    polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. In this study, we show that
    SusG, an outer membrane protein which has been shown genetically
    to be essential for starch utilization, has enzymatic activity.
    Results of protease accessibility experiments support the
    hypothesis that SusG is exposed on the cell surface. Results of
    [(14)C]starch binding assays, however, show that SusG plays a
    negligible role in binding of starch to the cell surface.
    Consistent with this, SusG has a relatively high K(m) for starch
    and by itself is not sufficient to allow cells to grow on starch
    or to bind starch. Hence, the main role of SusG is to hydrolyze
    starch, but the binding of starch to the cell surface is evidently
    mediated by other proteins presumably interacting with SusG.},

  abstract     = {Commensal gut microflora and dietary fiber protect
    against colonic inflammation and colon cancer through unknown
    targets. Butyrate, a bacterial product from fermentation of
    dietary fiber in the colon, has been implicated in this process.
    GPR109A (encoded by Niacr1) is a receptor for butyrate in the
    colon. GPR109A is also a receptor for niacin, which is also
    produced by gut microbiota and suppresses intestinal inflammation.
    Here we showed that Gpr109a signaling promoted anti-inflammatory
    properties in colonic macrophages and dendritic cells and enabled
    them to induce differentiation of Treg cells and IL-10-producing
    Tcells. Moreover, Gpr109a was essential for butyrate-mediated
    induction of IL-18 incolonicepithelium. Consequently, Niacr1-/-
    mice were susceptible to development of colonic inflammation and
    colon cancer. Niacin, a pharmacological Gpr109a agonist,
    suppressed colitis and colon cancer in a Gpr109a-dependent manner.
    Thus, Gpr10a has an essential role in mediating the beneficial
    effects of gut microbiota and dietary fiber in colon. ?? 2014

  abstract     = {Many recent studies rely on 16S rRNA-based
    sequencing approaches to analyze bacterial or archaeal communities
    found in soil and other environmental samples. While this approach
    is valuable for determining the relative abundances of different
    microbial taxa found in a given sample, it does not provide
    information on how the abundances of targeted microbes differ
    across samples. Here we demonstrate how the simple addition of an
    internal standard at the DNA extraction step allows for the
    quantitative comparison of how the total abundance of bacterial
    16S rRNA genes varies across samples. The reliability of this
    method was assessed in two ways. First, we spiked a dilution
    series of two different soils with internal standards to ascertain
    whether we could accurately quantify differences in cell
    abundances. We tested two different internal standards, adding DNA
    from Aliivibrio fischeri or Thermus thermophilus, bacterial taxa
    unlikely to be found in soil. The total abundances of 16S rRNA
    genes in soil were calculated from the number of 16S rRNA genes of
    the internal standard recovered in the sequence data. Both
    standards allowed us to accurately quantify total gene abundances
    in soil as there was a strong positive correlation between total
    16S rRNA gene estimations and the different starting amounts of
    soil extracted. We then tested whether we could use this approach
    to quantify differences in microbial abundances across a wide
    range of soil types; comparing estimated 16S rRNA gene abundances
    measured using this approach to microbial biomass determined with
    more standard methods: phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and
    substrate induced respiration (SIR) analysis. The gene abundances
    estimated with the internal standard sequencing approach were
    significantly correlated with the independent biomass
    measurements, and were in fact better correlated to SIR and PLFA
    estimates than either of these two biomass measurements were
    correlated with one another. Together, these results demonstrate
    that adding a DNA internal standard to soil or other environmental
    samples prior to DNA extraction is an effective method for
    comparing bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances across samples. Given
    the ease of adding DNA internal standards to soil samples prior to
    high-throughput marker gene sequencing, 16S rRNA gene abundances
    and bacterial community composition can now be determined
    simultaneously and routinely.},

  abstract     = {Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR or real-time PCR) approaches
    are now widely applied in microbial ecology to quantify the
    abundance and expression of taxonomic and functional gene markers
    within the environment. Q-PCR-based analyses combine 'traditional'
    end-point detection PCR with fluorescent detection technologies to
    record the accumulation of amplicons in 'real time' during each
    cycle of the PCR amplification. By detection of amplicons during
    the early exponential phase of the PCR, this enables the
    quantification of gene (or transcript) numbers when these are
    proportional to the starting template concentration. When Q-PCR is
    coupled with a preceding reverse transcription reaction, it can be
    used to quantify gene expression (RT-Q-PCR). This review firstly
    addresses the theoretical and practical implementation of Q-PCR
    and RT-Q-PCR protocols in microbial ecology, highlighting key
    experimental considerations. Secondly, we review the applications
    of (RT)-Q-PCR analyses in environmental microbiology and evaluate
    the contribution and advances gained from such approaches.
    Finally, we conclude by offering future perspectives on the
    application of (RT)-Q-PCR in furthering understanding in microbial
    ecology, in particular, when coupled with other molecular
    approaches and more traditional investigations of environmental

  abstract     = {Background: Treatment with the α-glucosidase
    inhibitor acarbose increases median lifespan by approximately 20\%
    in male mice and 5\% in females. This longevity extension differs
    from dietary restriction based on a number of features, including
    the relatively small effects on weight and the sex-specificity of
    the lifespan effect. By inhibiting host digestion, acarbose
    increases the flux of starch to the lower digestive system,
    resulting in changes to the gut microbiota and their fermentation
    products. Given the documented health benefits of short-chain
    fatty acids (SCFAs), the dominant products of starch fermentation
    by gut bacteria, this secondary effect of acarbose could
    contribute to increased longevity in mice. To explore this
    hypothesis, we compared the fecal microbiome of mice treated with
    acarbose to control mice at three independent study sites.
    Results: Microbial communities and the concentrations of SCFAs in
    the feces of mice treated with acarbose were notably different
    from those of control mice. At all three study sites, the bloom of
    a single bacterial taxon was the most obvious response to acarbose
    treatment. The blooming populations were classified to the largely
    uncultured Bacteroidales family Muribaculaceae and were the same
    taxonomic unit at two of the three sites. Total SCFA
    concentrations in feces were increased in treated mice, with
    increased butyrate and propionate in particular. Across all
    samples, Muribaculaceae abundance was strongly correlated with
    propionate and community composition was an important predictor of
    SCFA concentrations. Cox proportional hazards regression showed
    that the fecal concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and propionate
    were, together, predictive of mouse longevity even while
    controlling for sex, site, and acarbose. Conclusion: We have
    demonstrated a correlation between fecal SCFAs and lifespan in
    mice, suggesting a role of the gut microbiota in the
    longevity-enhancing properties of acarbose. Treatment modulated
    the taxonomic composition and fermentation products of the gut
    microbiome, while the site-dependence of the microbiota
    illustrates the challenges facing reproducibility and
    interpretation in microbiome studies. These results motivate
    future studies exploring manipulation of the gut microbial
    community and its fermentation products for increased longevity,
    and to test a causal role of SCFAs in the observed effects of
    acarbose.},

    only a small fraction of the total diversity that exists in
    nature. At all levels of bacterial phylogeny, uncultured clades
    that do not grow on standard media are playing critical roles in
    cycling carbon, nitrogen, and other elements, synthesizing novel
    natural products, and impacting the surrounding organisms and
    environment. While molecular techniques, such as metagenomic
    sequencing, can provide some information independent of our

    to learn new gene and pathway functions from pure sequence data. A
    true understanding of the physiology of these bacteria and their
    roles in ecology, host health, and natural product production
    requires their cultivation in the laboratory. Recent advances in
    growing these species include coculture with other bacteria,
    recreating the environment in the laboratory, and combining these
    approaches with microcultivation technology to increase throughput
    and access rare species. These studies are unraveling the
    molecular mechanisms of unculturability and are identifying growth
    factors that promote the growth of previously unculturable

  abstract     = {Summary Causal Bayesian Networks are a special class
    of Bayesian networks in which the hierarchy directly encodes the
    causal relationships between the variables. This allows to compute
    the effect of interventions, which are external changes to the
    system, caused by e.g. gene knockouts or an administered drug.
    Whereas numerous packages for constructing causal Bayesian
    networks are available, hardly any program targeted at downstream
    analysis exists. In this paper we present CausalTrail, a tool for
    performing reasoning on causal Bayesian networks using the
    do-calculus. CausalTrail's features include multiple data import
    methods, a flexible query language for formulating hypotheses, as
    well as an intuitive graphical user interface. The program is able
    to account for missing data and thus can be readily applied in
    multi-omics settings where it is common that not all measurements
    are performed for all samples., Availability and Implementation
    CausalTrail is implemented in C++ using the Boost and Qt5
    libraries. It can be obtained from

    Testing Program (ITP) evaluates agents hypothesized to increase
    healthy lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice. Each compound
    is tested in parallel at three sites, and all results are

    with four agents not previously tested: Protandim, fish oil,
    ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and metformin - the latter with and
    without rapamycin, and two drugs previously examined:
    17-alpha-estradiol and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), at doses
    greater and less than used previously. 17-alpha-estradiol at a
    threefold higher dose robustly extended both median and maximal
    lifespan, but still only in males. The male-specific extension of
    median lifespan by NDGA was replicated at the original dose, and
    using doses threefold lower and higher. The effects of NDGA were
    dose dependent and male specific but without an effect on maximal
    lifespan. Protandim, a mixture of botanical extracts that activate
    Nrf2, extended median lifespan in males only. Metformin alone, at
    a dose of 0.1\% in the diet, did not significantly extend
    lifespan. Metformin (0.1\%) combined with rapamycin (14 ppm)
    robustly extended lifespan, suggestive of an added benefit, based
    on historical comparison with earlier studies of rapamycin given
    alone. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, at a
    concentration previously tested (1000 ppm), significantly
    increased median longevity in males and 90th percentile lifespan
    in both sexes, even when treatment was started at 16 months.
    Neither fish oil nor UDCA extended lifespan. These results
    underscore the reproducibility of ITP longevity studies and
    illustrate the importance of identifying optimal doses in lifespan

    hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recent insights into
    intestinal homeostasis and uncovering of new pathways and targets
    have greatly reconciled our understanding of GVHD pathophysiology
    and will reshape contemporary GVHD prophylaxis and treatment.
    Gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD is the major cause of mortality.
    Emerging data indicate that intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and their
    niche Paneth cells are targeted, resulting in dysregulation of the
    intestinal homeostasis and microbial ecology. The microbiota and
    their metabolites shape the immune system and intestinal
    homeostasis, and they may alter host susceptibility to GVHD.
    Protection of the ISC niche system and modification of the
    intestinal microbiota and metabolome to restore intestinal
    homeostasis may, thus, represent a novel approach to modulate GVHD
    and infection. Damage to the intestine plays a central role in
    amplifying systemic GVHD by propagating a proinflammatory cytokine
    milieu. Molecular targeting to inhibit kinase signaling may be a
    promising approach to treat GVHD, ideally via targeting the
    redundant effect of multiple cytokines on immune cells and
    enterocytes. In this review, we discuss insights on the biology of
    GI GVHD, interaction of microflora and metabolome with the hosts,
    identification of potential new target organs, and identification
    and targeting of novel T cell-signaling pathways. Better
    understanding of GVHD biology will, thus, pave a way to develop
    novel treatment strategies with great clinical benefits.},

    rRNA gene have become a mainstay for characterizing microbial
    community structure over the past quarter century. More recently
    this approach has been overshadowed by metagenomics, which
    provides a global overview of a community's functional potential
    rather than just an inventory of its inhabitants. However, the
    pioneering 16S rRNA gene is making a comeback in its own right
    thanks to a number of methodological advancements including higher
    resolution (more sequences), analysis of multiple related samples
    (e.g. spatial and temporal series) and improved metadata, and use
    of metadata. The standard conclusion that microbial ecosystems are
    remarkably complex and diverse is now being replaced by detailed
    insights into microbial ecology and evolution based only on this
    one historically important marker gene.},

  abstract     = {Purpose Human microbiome studies are within the
    realm of compositional data with the absolute abundances of
    microbes not recoverable from sequence data alone. In
    compositional data analysis, each sample consists of proportions
    of various organisms with a sum constrained to a constant. This
    simple feature can lead traditional statistical treatments when
    naively applied to produce errant results and spurious
    correlations. Methods We review the origins of compositionality in
    microbiome data, the theory and usage of compositional data
    analysis in this setting and some recent attempts at solutions to
    these problems. Results Microbiome sequence data sets are
    typically high dimensional, with the number of taxa much greater
    than the number of samples, and sparse as most taxa are only
    observed in a small number of samples. These features of
    microbiome sequence data interact with compositionality to produce
    additional challenges in analysis. Conclusions Despite
    sophisticated approaches to statistical transformation, the
    analysis of compositional data may remain a partially intractable
    problem, limiting inference. We suggest that current research
    needs include better generation of simulated data and further
    study of how the severity of compositional effects changes when
    sampling microbial communities of widely differing diversity.},

  abstract     = {The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of
    microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic
    capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from
    otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides. Studies of a few
    unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in
    their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes,
    yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the
    genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut
    microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice
    suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by
    influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and
    how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize
    the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and
    dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their
    mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and
    host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154
    individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial
    bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their
    microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is
    shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial
    community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with
    a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and
    dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared
    microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an
    extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than
    at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with
    phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial
    diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and
    metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of
    organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at
    a functional level, and that deviations from this core are
    associated with different physiological states (obese compared
    with lean).},

    Previous studies have indicated that probiotics transiently reside

    carbohydrate metabolism in resident commensal bacterial species.
    In this study, it is demonstrated that the human gut commensal

    fructan exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesized by probiotic
    Lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 while only partially degrading
    reuteran and isomalto/malto-polysaccharide (IMMP) α-glucan EPS
    polymers. B. thetaiotaomicron metabolized these EPS molecules via
    the activation of enzymes and transport systems encoded by
    dedicated polysaccharide utilization loci specific for β-fructans
    and α-glucans. Reduced metabolism of reuteran and IMMP α-glucan
    EPS molecules may be due to reduced substrate binding by
    components of the starch utilization system (sus). This study
    reveals that microbial EPS substrates activate genes for

    stability of the human gut microbiota remain unresolved. We
    developed a generalizable model-guided framework to predict
    higher-dimensional consortia from time-resolved measurements of
    lower-order assemblages. This method was employed to decipher
    microbial interactions in a diverse human gut microbiome synthetic
    community. We show that pairwise interactions are major drivers of
    multi-species community dynamics, as opposed to higher-order
    interactions. The inferred ecological network exhibits a high
    proportion of negative and frequent positive interactions.
    Ecological drivers and responsive recipient species were
    discovered in the network. Our model demonstrated that a prevalent
    positive and negative interaction topology enables robust
    coexistence by implementing a negative feedback loop that balances
    disparities in monospecies fitness levels. We show that negative
    interactions could generate history-dependent responses of initial
    species proportions that frequently do not originate from
    bistability. Measurements of extracellular metabolites illuminated
    the metabolic capabilities of monospecies and potential molecular
    basis of microbial interactions. In sum, these methods defined the
    ecological roles of major human-associated intestinal species and
    illuminated design principles of microbial communities.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer is the most abundant cause of
    cancer mortality in the Western world. Nutrition and the microbial
    flora are considered to have a marked influence on the risk of
    colorectal cancer, the formation of butyrate and other short-chain
    fatty acids (SCFAs) possibly playing a major role as
    chemopreventive products of microbial fermentation in the colon.
    In this study, we investigated the effects of butyrate, other
    SCFAs, and of a number of phenolic SCFA and trans-cinnamic acid
    derivatives formed during the intestinal degradation of
    polyphenolic constituents of fruits and vegetables on global
    histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in nuclear extracts from colon
    carcinoma cell cultures using tert-butoxycarbonyl-lysine
    (acetylated)-4-amino-7-methylcoumarin (Boc-Lys(Ac)-AMC) as
    substrate. Inhibition of HDAC activity, e.g., by butyrate, is
    related to a suppression of malignant transformation and a
    stimulation of apoptosis of precancerous colonic cells. In nuclear
    extracts from HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells, butyrate was
    found to be the most potent HDAC inhibitor (IC50=0.09 mM), while
    other SCFAs such as propionate were less potent. In the same
    assay, p-coumaric acid (IC50=0.19 mM), 3-(4-OH-phenyl)-propionate
    (IC50=0.62 mM) and caffeic acid (IC50=0.85 mM) were the most
    potent HDAC inhibitors among the polyphenol metabolites tested.
    Interestingly, butyrate was also the most potent HDAC inhibitor in
    a whole-cell HeLa Mad 38-based reporter gene assay, while all
    polyphenol metabolites and all other SCFAs tested were much less
    potent; some were completely inactive. The findings suggest that
    butyrate plays an outstanding role as endogenous HDAC inhibitor in
    the colon, and that other SCFAs and HDAC-inhibitory polyphenol
    metabolites present in the colon seem to play a much smaller role,
    probably because of their limited levels, their marked
    cytotoxicity and/or their limited intracellular availability. ©

    proposed in Bergey's Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (2nd
    ed., release 5.0, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, 2004). It
    provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with
    confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of
    classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence ({$>$} or
    = 95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with
    the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline,
    the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA
    sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative
    higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on
    both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of
    confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or
    above down to the genus level, and the majority of the
    classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current
    taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be
    generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over
    the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and
    V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP
    Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA
    sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of

    developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on
    16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier
    with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented
    between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are

    associated with the beneficial effects of CR; however, it is
    unknown whether these effects of CR are causally mediated by gut

    microbiota-depleted mouse model to investigate the functional role
    of gut microbiota in CR. Depletion of gut microbiota rendered mice
    resistant to CR-induced loss of body weight, accompanied by~the
    increase in fat mass,~the reduction in lean mass and~the decline
    in metabolic rate. Depletion of gut microbiota led to increases in
    fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels independent of CR. A
    few metabolism-modulating hormones including leptin and insulin
    were altered by CR and/or gut microbiota depletion. In addition,
    CR altered the composition of gut microbiota with significant
    increases in major probiotic genera such as Lactobacillus and
    Bifidobacterium, together with~the decrease of Helicobacter. In
    addition, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation in mice
    fed with high-fat diet. Mice with transferred microbiota from

    exhibited metabolic improvement such as alleviated hepatic lipid

    and starch-fermenting bacteria were measured and fecal

    bacteria were also significantly greater with acarbose treatment.
    Butyrate in feces, measured either as concentration or as

    improved the correlation of BrdU and Ki-67 labeling (P = 0.013).
    Acarbose also augmented fecal butyrate (P = 0.0001), which was
    positively correlated with Ki-67 labeling (P = 0.003). p52 antigen
    had an earlier pattern of crypt distribution in subjects with a
    history of colon neoplasia but was not affected by acarbose use.
    Lewis-Y antigen was expressed earlier in the crypt with acarbose
    but had similar expression in the colonoscopy survey groups. The
    use of acarbose to enhance fecal butyrate concentration produced
    mucosal changes paralleling the findings in control subjects as
    opposed to those with neoplasia, supporting the concept of an
    antineoplastic role for butyrate.},

  abstract     = {For single-cell or metagenomic sequencing projects,
    it is necessary to sequence with a very high mean coverage in
    order to make sure that all parts of the sample DNA get covered by
    the reads produced. This leads to huge datasets with lots of
    redundant data. A filtering of this data prior to assembly is
    advisable. Titus Brown et al. (2012) presented the algorithm
    Diginorm for this purpose, which filters reads based on the
    abundance of their \$k\$-mers. We present Bignorm, a faster and
    quality-conscious read filtering algorithm. An important new
    feature is the use of phred quality scores together with a
    detailed analysis of the \$k\$-mer counts to decide which reads to
    keep. With recommended parameters, in terms of median we remove
    97.15\% of the reads while keeping the mean phred score of the
    filtered dataset high. Using the SDAdes assembler, we produce
    assemblies of high quality from these filtered datasets in a
    fraction of the time needed for an assembly from the datasets
    filtered with Diginorm. We conclude that read filtering is a
    practical method for reducing read data and for speeding up the
    assembly process. Our Bignorm algorithm allows assemblies of
    competitive quality in comparison to Diginorm, while being much
    faster. Bignorm is available for download at

    metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas
    Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no
    significant differences in the overall microbial community
    structure associated with the disease state, but several bacterial
    genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were
    under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading
    species, Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC
    (p{$<$}0.01). Proportionately higher amounts of butyrate were seen
    in stool of healthy individuals while relative concentrations of
    acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS profiling
    revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples

    sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical
    interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over
    several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros.
    Although we are typically interested in comparing relative
    abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can
    only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained
    from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative
    abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of
    taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a
    special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa
    in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are
    compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained
    by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the
    Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not
    applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the
    performance of existing normalization methods and differential
    abundance analyses. Effects on normalization: Most normalization
    methods enable successful clustering of samples according to
    biological origin when the groups differ substantially in their
    overall microbial composition. Rarefying more clearly clusters
    samples according to biological origin than other normalization
    techniques do for ordination metrics based on presence or absence.
    Alternate normalization measures are potentially vulnerable to
    artifacts due to library size. Effects on differential abundance
    testing: We build on a previous work to evaluate seven proposed
    statistical methods using rarefied as well as raw data. Our
    simulation studies suggest that the false discovery rates of many
    differential abundance-testing methods are not increased by
    rarefying itself, although of course rarefying results in a loss
    of sensitivity due to elimination of a portion of available data.
    For groups with large (\textasciitilde 10×) differences in the
    average library size, rarefying lowers the false discovery rate.
    DESeq2, without addition of a constant, increased sensitivity on
    smaller datasets ({$<$}20 samples per group) but tends towards a
    higher false discovery rate with more samples, very uneven
    (\textasciitilde 10×) library sizes, and/or compositional effects.
    For drawing inferences regarding taxon abundance in the ecosystem,
    analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) is not only very
    sensitive (for {$>$}20 samples per group) but also critically the
    only method tested that has a good control of false discovery
    rate. These findings guide which normalization and differential
    abundance techniques to use based on the data characteristics of a
    given study.},

    process of analyzing microbial commu- nities. Although this has
    been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome
    the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU
    assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm
    that it- eratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the
    Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality
    of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we
    compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences
    from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the
    OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5\%
    higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor
    and distance-based greedy cluster- ing with VSEARCH, respectively.
    Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the
    average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based
    greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the
    efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory
    required to perform the algorithm scaled qua- dratically with the
    number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant im-
    provement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously
    existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by
    limiting the splitting of similar se- quences into separate OTUs
    and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The
    development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant
    advance that is likely to have numerous other applications.},

    pathogens and are found in most anaerobic infections, with an
    associated mortality of more than 19\%. The bacteria maintain a
    complex and generally beneficial relationship with the host when
    retained in the gut, but when they escape this environment they
    can cause significant pathology, including bacteremia and abscess
    formation in multiple body sites. Genomic and proteomic analyses
    have vastly added to our understanding of the manner in which
    Bacteroides species adapt to, and thrive in, the human gut. A few
    examples are (i) complex systems to sense and adapt to nutrient
    availability, (ii) multiple pump systems to expel toxic
    substances, and (iii) the ability to influence the host immune
    system so that it controls other (competing) pathogens. B.
    fragilis, which accounts for only 0.5\% of the human colonic
    flora, is the most commonly isolated anaerobic pathogen due, in
    part, to its potent virulence factors. Species of the genus
    Bacteroides have the most antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the
    highest resistance rates of all anaerobic pathogens. Clinically,
    Bacteroides species have exhibited increasing resistance to many
    antibiotics, including cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole,

  abstract     = {Although it has long been recognized that the
    enteric community of bacteria that inhabit the human distal
    intestinal track broadly impacts human health, the biochemical
    details that underlie these effects remain largely undefined.
    Here, we report a broad MS-based metabolomics study that
    demonstrates a surprisingly large effect of the gut "microbiome"
    on mammalian blood metabolites. Plasma extracts from germ-free
    mice were compared with samples from conventional (conv) animals
    by using various MS-based methods. Hundreds of features were
    detected in only 1 sample set, with the majority of these being
    unique to the conv animals, whereas approximately 10\% of all
    features observed in both sample sets showed significant changes
    in their relative signal intensity. Amino acid metabolites were
    particularly affected. For example, the bacterial-mediated
    production of bioactive indole-containing metabolites derived from
    tryptophan such as indoxyl sulfate and the antioxidant
    indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) was impacted. Production of IPA was
    shown to be completely dependent on the presence of gut microflora
    and could be established by colonization with the bacterium
    Clostridium sporogenes. Multiple organic acids containing phenyl
    groups were also greatly increased in the presence of gut
    microbes. A broad, drug-like phase II metabolic response of the
    host to metabolites generated by the microbiome was observed,
    suggesting that the gut microflora has a direct impact on the drug
    metabolism capacity of the host. Together, these results suggest a
    significant interplay between bacterial and mammalian metabolism.},

    addition to providing a major source of reductive metabolizing
    capability, the gut microbiota provides a suite of additional

    dehydroxylation, demethylation, dehalogenation, and importantly,
    in the context of certain types of drug-related toxicity,
    conjugates hydrolysis reactions. In addition to direct effects,
    the gut microbiota can affect drug metabolism and toxicity
    indirectly via, for example, the modulation of host drug
    metabolism and disposition and competition of bacterial-derived
    metabolites for xenobiotic metabolism pathways. Also, of course,
    the therapeutic drugs themselves can have effects, both intended
    and unwanted, which can impact the health and composition of the

  abstract     = {The fermentation of starch in vitro produces a
    higher proportion of butyrate than the fermentation of most other
    substrates. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose increases the
    amount of starch entering the colon, and has been shown to
    increase faecal butyrate in humans. It is generally considered
    that colonic butyrate is quantitatively removed by the colonic
    mucosa and liver and does not appear in peripheral blood. However,
    studies in animals suggest that a small proportion of colonic
    butyrate reaches peripheral blood. Thus, we hypothesised that an
    increase in colonic butyrate production would result in a rise in
    serum butyrate in human subjects. To test this, subjects with
    impaired glucose tolerance were randomly treated in a double-blind
    fashion with placebo (n 11) or acarbose (n 11) (100 mg three times
    per day). Serum short-chain fatty acid concentrations were
    measured twelve times over 12 h with subjects eating a standard
    diet before randomization and after 4 months of therapy. At
    baseline, 12 h mean serum butyrate concentrations were similar in
    the placebo and acarbose groups (2.8 (SE 0.7) and 3.3 (SE 0.6)
    microM, respectively). After 4 months on placebo, mean serum
    butyrate (2.6 (SE 0.5) microM) was no different from baseline.
    However, after 4 months on acarbose, serum butyrate had increased
    to 4.2 (SE 1.0) microM, a value which differed significantly from
    both the baseline value in the acarbose group and the treatment
    value in the placebo group. We conclude that acarbose increased
    serum butyrate in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. These
    results support the hypothesis that increased colonic butyrate
    production in human subjects can be detected by an increase in
    serum butyrate.},

    fatty acids (SCFAs) with the emergence of prebiotics and
    probiotics aimed at improving colonic and systemic health. Dietary
    carbohydrates, specifically resistant starches and dietary fiber,
    are substrates for fermentation that produce SCFAs, primarily
    acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as end products. The rate and
    amount of SCFA production depends on the species and amounts of
    microflora present in the colon, the substrate source and gut
    transit time. SCFAs are readily absorbed. Butyrate is the major
    energy source for colonocytes. Propionate is largely taken up by
    the liver. Acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be
    metabolized by peripheral tissues. Specific SCFA may reduce the
    risk of developing gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, and
    cardiovascular disease. Acetate is the principal SCFA in the
    colon, and after absorption it has been shown to increase
    cholesterol synthesis. However, propionate, a gluconeogenerator,
    has been shown to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Therefore,
    substrates that can decrease the acetate: propionate ratio may
    reduce serum lipids and possibly cardiovascular disease risk.
    Butyrate has been studied for its role in nourishing the colonic
    mucosa and in the prevention of cancer of the colon, by promoting
    cell differentiation, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of
    transformed colonocytes; inhibiting the enzyme histone deacetylase
    and decreasing the transformation of primary to secondary bile
    acids as a result of colonic acidification. Therefore, a greater
    increase in SCFA production and potentially a greater delivery of
    SCFA, specifically butyrate, to the distal colon may result in a
    protective effect. Butyrate irrigation (enema) has also been
    suggested in the treatment of colitis. More human studies are now
    needed, especially, given the diverse nature of carbohydrate
    substrates and the SCFA patterns resulting from their
    fermentation. Short-term and long-term human studies are
    particularly required on SCFAs in relation to markers of cancer
    risk. These studies will be key to the success of dietary
    recommendations to maximize colonic disease prevention.},

    the treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) because of
    its relative safety, low cost, and beneficial effects on blood
    glucose and cardiovascu-lar mortality 1,2 . However, its mechanism
    of action remains unclear. Although metformin is generally
    considered to mediate its antihyper-glycemic effects by
    suppressing hepatic glucose output through the activation of
    AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent 3–5 and
    AMPK-independent pathways 6–8 in the liver, accumulating evi-dence
    indicates that it might also act through pathways in the gut 9,10
    . For example, its glucose-lowering effect is more pronounced when
    given orally than when administered intravenously 11 . In
    addition, a study comparing metformin formulations with reduced
    and normal plasma exposure provided evidence to indicate that the
    lower bowel is a major site of action for metformin 12 .
    Furthermore, recent stud-ies in both rodents 13–15 and humans
    16–18 suggest that gut microbial changes might contribute to the
    antidiabetic effect of metformin. So far, however, it is not known
    how metformin affects the gut micro-biota of individuals with
    treatment-naive T2D, nor how metformin interacts with gut
    bacteria. Here we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled,
    double-blind study in individuals with newly diagnosed T2D on a
    calorie-restricted diet, and we combined metagenomics and targeted
    metabolomics to investigate the effect of metformin on the
    composition and function of the gut microbiota. We also
    transferred human fecal samples to germ-free mice to study the
    effects of metformin-altered microbiota on host glucose

    play key roles in the health of the animals and plants with which
    they are associated. Such ecosystems are often represented by a
    directed, signed and weighted ecological network, where nodes
    represent microbial taxa and edges represent ecological
    interactions. Inferring the underlying ecological networks of
    microbial communities is a necessary step towards understanding
    their assembly rules and predicting their dynamical response to
    external stimuli. However, current methods for inferring such
    networks require assuming a particular population dynamics model,
    which is typically not known a priori. Moreover, those methods
    require fitting longitudinal abundance data, which is not readily
    available, and often does not contain the variation that is
    necessary for reliable inference. To overcome these limitations,
    here we develop a new method to map the ecological networks of
    microbial communities using steady-state data. Our method can
    qualitatively infer the inter-taxa interaction types or signs
    (positive, negative or neutral) without assuming any particular

    dynamics is assumed to follow the classic Generalized
    Lotka-Volterra model, our method can quantitatively infer the
    inter-taxa interaction strengths and intrinsic growth rates. We
    systematically validate our method using simulated data, and then
    apply it to four experimental datasets of microbial communities.
    Our method offers a novel framework to infer microbial

    key step towards reliable modeling of complex, real-world

    thus, α-glucosidase inhibitor is used for the treatment of

    effect of α-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, on age-related
    glucose intolerance and pancreatic atrophy in the Long-Evans
    Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rat. The first group of rats received a
    standard rat diet (control). The second group received a diet
    containing acarbose (150 mg/100 g food) from 12 to 28 weeks and
    then switched to a standard rat diet until 72 weeks of age
    (A12-28W). The third group was administered the same diet
    containing acarbose from 12 to 72 weeks of age (A12-72W). Fasting
    serum glucose and insulin concentrations gradually increased with
    increasing age in the control group, but these increases were
    completely prevented (A12-72W) or delayed (A12-28W) by acarbose
    treatment. In addition, acarbose treatment prevented the
    deterioration in insulin resistance with increasing age. At 72
    weeks of age, pancreatic wet weight and DNA content in the A12-72W
    group were significantly higher than those in the control group.
    Although most islets were enlarged, and some portions of
    pancreatic tissue contained fatty and connective tissue in the
    control group, these alterations were mild in the A12-28W group
    and remained minimal in the A12-72W group. Our study suggests that

    Here we show that life-long calorie restriction on both high-fat

    the overall structure of the gut microbiota of C57BL/6 J mice.
    Calorie restriction enriches phylotypes positively correlated with

    and reduces phylotypes negatively correlated with lifespan. These
    calorie restriction-induced changes in the gut microbiota are
    concomitant with significantly reduced serum levels of

    sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on data
    structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie

    updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is
    necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On sparse
    data sets this data structure is considerably more memory
    efficient than any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a

    acarbose is an efficacious medicine for the treatment and
    prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the
    response of gut microbiota to acarbose is important, as the
    microbiota may have a critical role in the development of
    metabolic diseases, and acarbose is metabolized exclusively within
    the gastrointestinal tract. We explored the changes in the
    proportion and diversity of gut microbiota before and after
    treatment with acarbose in patients with prediabetes., METHODS: We
    designed a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial in
    which 52 Chinese patients with prediabetes by an oral glucose
    tolerance test (OGTT) with a BMI of 18-35 kg/m2 were randomly
    allocated to treatment with acarbose or placebo. Gut microbiota
    characterizations were determined with 16S rDNA-based
    high-throughput sequencing., RESULTS: Of the 52 participants who
    entered the study, 40 (76.9\%) completed the protocol. On the
    basis of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) profiles, a total of
    107 OTUs were significantly altered after acarbose treatment, with
    76 (71\%) assigned to the order of Clostridiales. Ruminococcaceae
    (15 OTUs) and Lachnospiraceae (22 OTUs) decreased in response to
    acarbose, and 48 OTUs increased by 12.8-fold, including
    Lactobacillaceae (8 of 9 belonging to Lactobacillus),
    Ruminococcaceae (6 of 11 belonging to Faecalibacterium), and
    Veillonellaceae (8 of 15 belonging to Dialister). At genera level,
    five flourished after treatment with acarbose, including
    Lactobacillus and Dialister, while Butyricicoccus,
    Phascolarctobacterium, and Ruminococcus were inhibited.,
    CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the benefits of acarbose for
    T2DM may correlate with the selective modulation of the gut

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Gene content differences in human gut
    microbes can lead to inter-individual phenotypic variations such
    as digestive capacity. It is unclear whether gene content
    variation is caused by differences in microbial species
    composition or by the presence of different strains of the same
    species; the extent of gene content variation in the latter is
    unknown. Unlike pan-genome studies of cultivable strains, the use
    of metagenomic data can provide an unbiased view of structural
    variation of gut bacterial strains by measuring them in their
    natural habitats, the gut of each individual in this case,
    representing native boundaries between gut bacterial populations.
    We analyzed publicly available metagenomic data from fecal samples
    to characterize inter-individual variation in gut bacterial
    species.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: A comparison of
    11 abundant gut bacterial species showed that the gene content of
    strains from the same species differed, on average, by 13\%
    between individuals. This number is based on gene deletions only
    and represents a lower limit, yet the variation is already in a
    similar range as observed between completely sequenced strains of
    cultivable species. We show that accessory genes that differ
    considerably between individuals can encode important functions,
    such as polysaccharide utilization and capsular polysaccharide
    synthesis loci.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION:
    Metagenomics can yield insights into gene content variation of
    strains in complex communities, which cannot be predicted by
    phylogenetic marker genes alone. The large degree of
    inter-individual variability in gene content implies that strain
    resolution must be considered in order to fully assess the
    functional potential of an individual's human gut microbiome.},
